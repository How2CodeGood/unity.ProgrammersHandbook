    involve a blockage of the large intestine resulting from a diber-deficient diet.
    The blockage stops the natural flow of fluids which facilitates the growth of
    harmful bacteria from the intestinal tract... resulting in inflammation of the
    appendix------->   \r\nAsthma, \"\"\"starving for air\"\"\", x, x, x, \"described
    as \"\"starving for air\"\". Typical symptoms of an asthma attack are coughing...
    wheezing... a feeling of tightness in the chest... and difficulty breathing\",
    mullein oil is said to be a powerful remedy for bronchial congestion. The oil
    stops coughs... unclogs bronchial tubes... and helps clear up asthma attacks.
    Users say when they take it in tea or fruit juice... the effect is almost immediate.
    Nettle can be helpful in relieving respiratory problems. It is rich in butyric
    acid... necessary for a healthy metabolism... as well as other vitamins and minerals.
    Eat a diet of fresh fruits... vegetables... nuts... oatmeal... brown rice...
    and whole grains. The diet should be relatively high in protein... low in carbohydrates
    and contain no sugar. Include garlic and onions into you diet... they contain
    quercetin and mustard oils... which are shown to inhibit an enzyme that aids

    ...\nCombination inhaler. ...\nTheophylline. ...\nShort-acting beta-agonists.
    ...\nAnticholinergics.\", Asthma is a lung disease that causes obstruction of
    the airways. The spasns characterizing an acute attack are not the cause of the
    disorder... but a result of chronic inflammation and hypersensitivity of the
    airways to certain stimuli. An attack can be triggered if the individual has
    been exposed to an allergen or irritants. There is two asthmas. allergic and
    nonallergic... although the two often occur together. Common ones include dander...
    chemicals... drugs... dust mites... enviornmental pollutants... deathers... food
    additives (such as sulfities)... fumes... mold... and tabacco smoke. Asthma can
    be difficult to diagnose conclusively. Its symptoms are similar to emphysema...
    bronchitis... and lower respitory infections. To distinguish from other... a
    physician may recommend blood tests... chest x-rays... and spirometry (a procedure
    that measures air into and out of the lungs) If not treated properly... bronchial
    asthma can lead to pulmonary emphysema. Cardiac asthma is the same symptoms...
    but is caused by heart failure.------->   \r\nBee Sting, localized swelling...

    acute pain that may throb or burn. Highly allergic allergies... where severe
    reactions can occur. Symtpoms of an allergic reaction include difficulty swallowing...
    hoarseness... labored breathing... weakness... confusion... severe swelling...
    and a feeling of impending disaster. Anaphlactic shock... leaving unconscious
    or severe cases death. Anaphylactic shock can cause symtoms such as bluish skin...
    coughing... difficulty breathing... dizziness... hives... nausea... severely
    swollen eyes... lips or tongue... stomach cramps... and wheezing., Poultices
    made from comfrey... slippery elm... and white oak bark and leaves can ease pain
    and promote healing. Take echinacea or goldenseal in tea or capsule form to boost
    immune function. Juniper tea cleanses the venom from your internal system and
    makes excellent poultice when the berries are crushed and applied to the sting.
    Drink as much yellow dock tea as you can... or take 2 capsules or yellow dock
    every hour until symptoms are relieved., If you are highly allergic and prone
    to anap, in some people... honeybee and yellow jacket stings can cause more serious
    reactions than the stings of hornets and wasps. ------->   \r\nBronchitis, x,
    x, x, x, Symptoms- building of mucus... inflammation of broncial tubes... coughing...
    fever... pain in the chest and / or back... fatigue... sore throat... difficulty
    breath... and often... sudden chills and shaking. Bronchospasm... a contraction
    of the smooth muscle in the walls of the bronchi... may also occur. Swelling
    of the mucous membranes and hypersecretion by the broncial glands frequently
    accompany bronchospasm., Herbal medicine has proven very effective. American
    and Siberian ginseng are esspecially good for the lungs... they clear bronchial
    passages and reduce inflammation... but be careful if you have high blood pressure
    (American) and hypoglycemia... heart disorder... high blood pressure (Siberian).
    Myrrh... olive oil extract... and pau d'arco are natural antibiotics. Black radish...
    chickweed...elderberry... ginkgo biloba... lobelia... and mullein improve lung
    and broncial congestion and circulation. Boswellia... bromelain... cayenne...
    ginger... and peppermint aid in reducing inflammation. Expectorant herbs such
    as cayenne... elecampane... horehound... hyssop... and mullein have been effective
    in clearing congestion Ephedra (ma huang) is good for relieving nasal and chest
    congestion. This botanical acts like epinephrine. Inhaling the vapors of eucalyptus
    leaves helps to relieve respiratory problems. Include onions and garlic in your
    diet. They contain quercetin and mustard oils. Drink plenty of fluids. Diet...
    nutrition... and environment all play important roles in any respiratory disease.,
    \"If bacteria are the cause of acute bronchitis... treatment with antibiotics
    may be necessary to cure the infection and to prevent pneumonia from developing.
    These include\u2026 Extended macrolides like Zithromax (azithromycin)\nFluoroquinolones
    like Cipro (ciprofloxacin) and Levaquin (levofloxacin)\nAminopenicillins like
    Principen (ampicillin)... Moxatag (amoxicillin)... and Hetacin (hetacillin)\nCephalosporins.\",
    Bronchitis is an inflammation or obstruction in the broncial tubes. This inflammation
    results in a buildup of mucus. Bronchitis can be either acute or chronic. Acute
    cronhtiis usualy is cause by infection... which can be bacterial... viral...
    chlamydial... mycoplasmal... or caused by a combination of agents. It typically
    follows an upper respirtrory tract infection... such as a cold or influenza.
    Most cases of acute bronchitis are self-limiting... with full recovery in a matter
    of weeks. Chronic bronchitis results from frequent irritation of the lungs...
    such as from exposure to cigarette smoke... air pollutants... or other noxious
    fumes... rather than from infection.------->   \r\nCancer, x, x, x, x, External
    factors include unhealthy workplace environments and exposure to air and water
    pollution... chemicals... pesticides... and herbicides... Internal factors include
    both genetics and infections. Lifestyle factors are those we personally can most
    readily control. These are also the factors scientists believe account for the
    largest proportion of cancers. Include diet... smoking... drinking... and sun
    exposure. Persons exposed to cigarette smoke have significantly higher rates
    of lung cancer than other people. Regular alcohol consuption increases the risk
    of mouth and throat cancers. A diet that is high in fat and low in fiber is associated
    with a great risk of colorectal cancer and is a factor in breast and prostate
    cancer as well. Health... poor diet... lack of exercise... and unhealthy lifestyle
    elements are responsible for about 65 percent of cancer deaths. There are more
    than 100 different varieties of cancer. They have different causes... cause different
    symptoms... and vary in aggressiveness (the speed at which they spread). However...
    most types of cancer fall into one of the four broad categories (Carcinomas-
    cancers that affect the skin... mucous membranes... glands... and internal organs.
    Leukemias- cancers of blood-forming tissues. Sarcomas- cancers that affect muscles...
    connective tissues... and bones. Lymphomas- cancers that affect the lymphatic
    system. The seven classic early warning signs of cancer are remembered as CAUTION...
    and can be spelled out by first letter. - Change in bowel or bladder habits -
    A sore that does not heal - Unusual bleeding or discharge - Thickening or lump
    in breast or elsewhere - Indigestion or difficulty in swallowing - Obvious change
    in a wart or a mole - Nagging cough or hoarseness., Most developing cancers can
    be cured of... and can be reduced by adopting a healthy lifestyle. The nutritional
    program and other recommendations outlined in this section are designed for persons
    who have been diagnosed with cancer... as well as for those who wish to enhance
    their chances of avoiding this disease. Alternate the following in your cancer
    prevention or cancer therapy program: astragalus... birch... burdock root...
    cat's claw... chaparral... chuchuhuasi (rainforest herb)... cranberry... dandelion...
    echinacea... fennel... green tea... licorice... macela... milk thistle... parsley...
    pau d'arco... red clover... and suma. Spices such as cardamom... cayenne pepper...
    ginger... rosemary... sage... thyme... and turmeric have anti-cancer properties.
    Cook all sprouts slightly. Eat onions and use garlic liberally... as it enhances
    the immune system and is a good cancer fighter. Try to eat 7 servings of whole
    grain foods every day. Eat ten raw almonds every day. Eat as many tomatoes and
    tomato based products as you can. Lycopene... an antioxidant agent in tomatoes...
    protects cells from ocidants associated with cancer. Eating a diet that includes
    plenty of tomatoes cuts the risk of cervical... lung... stomach... and prostate
    cancers. Preliminary reports suggest it may also prevent breast... colorectal...
    esophagus... mouth... and pancreatic cancers. Eat alot of tart cherries... both
    is fresh and pies... jams... and sugar free juice... they contain anthocyanins...
    antioxidants that may help prevent cancer and heart disease. Drink beet juice
    (froom roots and greens)... carrot juice (a source of beta-carotene)... fresh
    cabbage juice... and asparagus juice often. Grape... black cherry... and all
    dark-coloured juices are good. Apple juice fresh... fruit juice in the morning...
    and vegetable in the afternoon. Various types of mushrooms can get good source
    of vitamin D... B1 (thiamine)... b2(riboflavin)... b3 (ciacin)... minerals and
    amino acids. They have the ability to enhance the body's immune system T cells
    that seek and destroy cancer cells. Siitake... zhu ling... enoki... reishi...
    and maitake mushrooms have anti-cancer properties. Genistein and diadzein...
    two isoflavones you soy... act as antioxidants and may protect against most forms
    of cancer. D-glucaric acid... a phytochemical found in broccoli... brussel sprots...
    cauliflower... has shown evidence in several clinical studies of reducting the
    incidence of cancers of the breast... lung... liver... and skin. it is also found
    in supplemental form combined with calcium (calcium d-glucarate) high levels
    of antioxidants have a protective effect against cancerous tumors. Calcium may
    prevent precancerous cells from becoming cancerous. Low levels of selenium have
    been associated with greater risk of several types of cancer... including leukemia...
    esophageal... lung... colorectal... prostate... breast... and ovarian cancers.
    BE CAREFUL- over 800 micrograms is toxic to the body. They should be discussed
    with a physiciian. Dietary sources of selenium include brazil nuts... tuna...
    flounder... pork... turkey... pasta... bagels... pinto beans... and navy beans.
    Supplemental of vitamins A C and E can decrease the effect of lipid peroxidation...
    or the oxidation of body fats... which leads to the creation of free radicals
    in the body., Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is a potent chemotherpeutic drug used
    for treating many forms of cancer. However... irreversible heart damage can occur
    with this. Side effects will be slightly alleviated with vitamins A and E and
    selenium. ONYX-015 is a genetically engineered virus that is designed to infect
    and kill cancer cells without harming healthy ones. Antiostatin and endostatin...
    promising anti-cancer agents that stop the growth of new blood vessels to feed
    tumors. BR96-DOX... a drug that zeroes in on cancer cells... leaving the healthy
    cells alone. Its active ingredient is doxorubicin... a proven chemotherapy cancer-killing
    substance. DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is belived to help prevent cancer by
    blocking an enzyme... Grape seed extract to not only enhance the development
    of normal cells... but also inhibit abnormal cell growth., The entire human body
    is made up of cells... each of which contains its own genetic material... or
    DNA- a long string of molecules that tells the cell what to do. In a healthy
    body... cells divide at a controlled rate so as to grow and repair damaged tissues
    and replace dying cells. This predetermined rate of cell division is what keeps
    our bodies healthy. If cells keep multiplying when new ones are not necessary...
    a mass of tissue called a growth... or tumor... is formed. A tumor can be either
    benign or malignant. Begign tumors are not cancerous. They can occur anywhere
    in the body and generally do not pose a threat to health... do not metastasize
    (spread to other parts of the body)... and do not grow back if removed. Malignant
    tumors are cancerous. They are usually serious and can be life-threatening. Malignant
    tumors grow uncontrollably... interefere with normal metabolic and organ function...
    and have the ability to metastasize and invade other tissues. Each individual
    reacts differently. A combination of genetic... behavioural... environmental...
    and lifestyle factors are believed to be involved in turning normal cells into
    abnormal cells... and abnormal cells into cancer. There are factors called inhibitors
    (such as certain vitamins and nutrients found in fruits and vegetables) that
    re believed to slow the process... while other factors... promoters (such as
    smoking or eating a high fat diet)... can speed up the process. Can be divided
    into external... internal... and lifestyle.------->   \r\nCandidiasis, x, x,
    x, x, Symtpoms are wide... these include constipation... diarrhea... colitis...
    abdominal pain... headaches... bad breath... rectal itching... impotence... memory
    loss... moss swings... prostatitis... canker sores... persistent heartburn...
    muscle... and joint pain... sore throat... congrestion... nagging cough... numbness
    in the face or extremities... tingling sensations... acne... night sweats...
    severe itching... clogged sinuses... PMS... burning tongue... white spots on
    the tongue and the mouth... extreme fatigue... vaginitis... kidney and bladder
    infections... arthritis... depression... hyperactivity... hypothyroidism... adrenal
    problems... and even diabetes. Symptoms often wrosen in damp or mold places...
    or after consumptions of foods containing sugar and / or yeast. Because of its
    many and varied symptoms... this disorder is often misdiagnosed. When it infects
    the mouth... it is called thrush. White sores form on the tongue... gums... and
    inside the cheeks., Aloe vera juice has been shown to boost the white blood cells'
    ability to kill yeast cells. Olive leaf extract with oleuropein is a powerful
    healer of microbial infections. Pau d'arco contains an antibacterial and antifungal
    agent. Wild oregano oil is a potent antiseptic... powerful in killing range of
    fungi. Eat vegetables... fish... and gluten-free grains such as brown rice and
    millet. Eat plain yogurt that contains live yogurt cultures. Eat plenty of leafy
    greens... alfalfa... strawberries... whole grains... and yogurt can restore the
    vitamin K balance., x, Candida albicans... a single-celled fungus... is always
    present in the genital and intestinal tract. If it is present in disproportionate
    quantities... however... it can cause infection. Diaper rash... vaginitis...
    and thrush are some of the possible manifestations of candida infection. Because
    candidiasis can affect various parts of the body- the most common being the mouth...
    ears... nose... toenails... fingernails... gastrointestinal tract... and vagina-
    it can be characterized by a wide array of symptoms. ------->   \r\nChickenpox,
    x, x, x, x, The Symptoms are usually mild... with a low-grade fever... general
    fatigue... and a characteristic itchy rash. Contact a doctor immediately if symptoms
    include dizziness... a fever higher than 103 degrees farenheit... rapid heartbeat...
    shortness of breath... loss of muscle coordination... tremors... vomitting...
    and / or stiff neck., Catnip tea sweetened with molasses is good for fever and
    can be given to infants and children as well as to adults. For a child over age
    two... catnip tea enemas can reduce fevers. Other recommonded herbs include burdock
    root... echinacea... ginger... goldenseal... pau d'arco... and St. John's wort.
    Drink freshly made juices with protein powder and brewer's yeast added. Also
    drink pure vegetable broth., Never give aspirin to a child who has a fever. Studies
    have shown an increased risk of Reye's syndrome... a rare and potentially fatal
    disorder... in children given aspirin for fever. Acyyclovir (Zovirax) is an antiviral
    medication the lessens the severity of symptoms and shortens the duration of
    rash formation. It is commonly used for severe chickenpox... premature babies...
    adolescents... and adults. A chickenpox vaccine called Varivax was approved by
    the FDA in 1995. Children older than thirteen who have not had chickenpox and
    have never been vaccinated should  receive two doses of the vaccine... four to
    eight weeks appart. The vaccine is 70 to 90 percent effective in preventing chickenpox...
    however... its long term effectiveness is not yet known., \"Chickenpox is a very
    common and highly contagious disease... The same virus that causes chickenpox
    - Varicella zoster - can lie dormant for years... then resurface as shingles
    in adulthood. It is transmitted by direct contact with an infected person or
    through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Outbreaks are common
    within families and in schools and day-care facilities. Symptoms do not appear
    until after a person reaches the infectious stage... so it is difficult to isolate
    those who are contagious. Repeated exposures to the virus during the incubation
    period can result in worse symptoms. One bout with chickenpox generally affords
    lifetime immunity against the illness. Second attacks are possible... but rare.
    Symptoms usually starts between seven and twenty one days after exposure to the
    virus. Twenty-four to thirty six hours later... small round \"\"pimples\"\" appear
    on the face and body. They are filled with fluid and look like water blisters.
    The fluid leaks from the swollen areas of the skin... forming a crust. These
    eruptions continue in cycles... lasting from three days to one week. The blisters
    are infectious and itchy... and scratching them can lead to bacterial infection
    and scarring. Once the scabs are gone... the individual is no longer infectious.
    Anyone with an impaired immune system... such as a person whose immune system
    is suppressed by drugs or who has a disorder can develop pneumonia or encephalitis...
    an infection of the brain.\"------->   \r\nCommon Cold, x, x, x, x, The well
    known symptoms include head congestion... nasal congestion... sore throat...
    coughing... headache... sneezing... and watery eyes. Children may develop a low
    grade fever... but this is rare in adults. Colds usually strike eighteen to twenty
    four hours after the virus enters the body. It can sometimes lead to bronchitis...
    a middle ear infection... or sinus infection. Congestion... cough... and / or
    sore throat are signs of a cold... but if these symptoms occur together with
    fever or fatigue... you may have the flu., Astralagus... native to Mongolia and
    China... helps promotes the multiplication of the white blood cells that are
    vital for fighting infection. Boneset... a native american herb... may be used
    to treat a fever. For fever... take catnip tea enemas and 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon
    of lobelia tincture every three to four hours until fever drops. (do not take
    lobelia internally on an ongoing basis. Cat's claw is useful for easing the symptoms
    of a cold. Chuan xin lian... a chinese herbal remedy clears the mucus from the
    respirtatory tract. Ephedra (ma huang) is helpful for congestion and coughing
    (do not use this herb if you suffer from anxiety... glaucoma... heart disease...
    high blood pressure... or insomnia... or taking monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor
    drug for depression). At the first sign of a cold... use an alcohol-free echinacea
    and goldenseal combination extract to boost your immune system and keep the virus
    from multiplying. 1 dropperful... hold for 5 minutes... then sweall... do this
    every 3 hours for three days. Elderberry is recommended for upper respiratory
    infections and headaches associated with colds. It promotes sweating and can
    break a fever. Research has found that elderberry is effective against colds
    because it contains antioxidant flavonoids that protect cell walls against foreign
    substances. Eucalyptus oil is helpful for relieving congestion. Put 5 drops in
    a hot bath. Ginger... pau d'arco... slippery elm... and yarrow tea can help the
    common cold. Hyssop... an evergreen that can be taken as a tea... acts as an
    expectorant and has antiviral properties. Mullein is useful for coughs and congestion.
    Red clover helps clear accumulated toxins in the lymphatic system. Wild cherry
    bark soothes a cough. Take vitamin C and zinc lozenges at the first sign of sore
    throat or stuffiness in the head or nose., x, The common cold is an infection
    of the upper respiratory tract caused by a virus. Cold weather does not cause
    colds... although most colds are caught in the fall and winter. This is because
    most cold viruses thrive better in colder temperatures... when there is less
    humidity in the atmosphere. There are over 200 viruses that can cause the common
    cold... an infection of the upper respiratory tract... but the most common ones
    are rhinoviruses. ------->   \r\nCroup, x, x, x, x, The sufferer has difficulty
    breathing... a harsh... barking cough... hoarseness... tightness in the lungs...
    and feelings of suffocation, echinacea... fenugreek... tyme. Echinacea tincture
    should be taken if a fever is present. Take 15 drops in liquid every three to
    four hours. Put a few drops of eucalyptus oil in a vaporizer and inhale the steam.
    Give a child with croup very warm ginger herb baths... then immediately wrap
    the child in a heavy towel or blanket... and put him or her to be to perspire.
    This will loosen mucus and rid the body of toxins. You can also let your child
    stay in the steam filled bathroom for ten to fifteen minutes. THe mositure makes
    it easier to breath. Give a child with croup plenty of fluids to help to thin
    mucus. If the child is having difficulty breathing... take him or her to the
    emergency room of the nearest hospital for treatment and for x-rays of the larynx.
    Oxygen may be needed. Parents must be alert for signs of increased breating difficulty.,
    Croup is a viral infection... so antibiotics will not help., Croup or laryngotracheobronchitis...
    is a viral infection that causes the larynx or trachea (the upper part of the
    windpipe... near the vocal cords) to narrow due to swelling. The larynx goes
    into spasms. Croups have the hallmarks of being a common cold. It starts off
    with congestion... a runny nose... and a cough that develops into the distinctive
    barking cough associated with croup... and also the hard wheezing noise. Croup
    most commonly occurs in young children and babies between the age of three months
    and three years whose whose airways are much narrower than those of adults. In
    the past... this illness was often cause by the measles virus... but now that
    children are immunized against measles... croup has become much less common than
    it once was. The virus usually runs its course in five to six days.------->  
    \r\nCystic Fibrosis, x, x, x, x, Pseudoemonas aeruginosa (also common in cancer
    and burn patients) is the bacteria that most commonly colonizes the lungs...
    resulting in chronic coughing and wheezing... difficulty breathing... and recurrent
    lung infections. Once established... the bacteria remain in the lungs and are
    responsible for repeated outbreaks of infection. They form their own dense structure...
    called a biofilm... and are immune to most current treatments. They also produce
    toxic proteins that can cause tissue damage and weaken the immune system. The
    lungs of many children with CF are inhabited or colonized by the Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa bacteria before they are ten years of age. Persons with this disease
    also lose excessive amounts of salt through their sweat glands. Sweating may
    be profuse... and the sweat itself contains abnormally high concentrations of
    sodium... potassium... and chloride salts. Other signs of CF include clubbing
    of the fingers and toes (a result of poor circulation)... greasy... bulky...
    foul-smelling stools... and salty tasting skin. The reproductive organs may be
    affected... causing infertility in almost all men and some women., \"Alfalfa
    extract supplies vitamin K and necessary minerals... which are often deficient
    in those with cystic fibrosis due to absorption problems. It is also a good source
    of chlorophyll. Boswella... bromelain... cayenne... ginger... and peppermint
    can aid in reducing inflammation... expectorant herbs such as cayenne... elecampane...
    garlic... horehound... hyssop... and mullein may be effective in helping to clear
    some of the congestion. Eucalyptus... garlic... onion... tea tree oil... and
    thyme have natural antiseptic properties and fight infection. Echinacea is good
    for building up the immune system. So are licorice and Siberian ginseng... but
    do take carefully under doctor's supervision. Other herbs that are beneficial
    include ginger... and yarrow tea. Eat a diet consisting of 75 percent raw fruits
    and vegetables... and raw nuts and seeds. Make sure your intake of calories...
    protein... and other nutrients is adequate. People with CF require as much as
    50 percent more of many nutirents than normal. Take supplements to provide required
    enzymes... vitamins... and minerals. Include in the diet foods that are high
    in germanium... such as garlic... shiitake mushrooms... and onions. Germaninium
    helps to improve tissue oxygenation at the cellular level. During hot weather...
    drink plenty of fluids and increase salt intake. Cooked and processed foods cause
    excess mucus buildup and drain the body of energy. These foods are harder to
    digest. If you take antibiotics... take acidophilus to replace \"\"friendly\"\"
    bacteria.\", The symptoms of cystic fibrosis are normally controlled with a number
    of different drugs. Antibiotics are used to combat the infections to which people
    with CF are prone... especially infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa... a type
    of microbe that is attracted to the sticky mucus in the lungs. Pancrelipase (also
    sold under a variety of brand names... in including Viokase) is a prescription
    product containing a combination of digestive enzymes that is often prescribed
    for people with CF and other pancreatic insufficiencies. Many people also take
    anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen (Advil... Nuprin... and others)...
    naproxen (Naprosyn)... or prednisone (Deltasone and others). Gene therapy has
    been used on rats... and has indicated that with normal CF genes successfuly
    introduced into cells with CF... replacing the defective with the normal ones
    in just 10 percent of the lung lining cells improves lung function. As part of
    this gene therapy... work is proceeding with vector aerosols. A vector is like
    a shuttle that can deliver a good copy of the devective gene to the appropriate
    place in the body. The drug amiloride (midamor... Moduretic)... which is used
    as a adjunct to treatment with some diuretic drugs... is being tested as a treatment
    for CF. It is believed to thin lung secretions by blocking sodium uptake by lung
    cells. When the antibiotic tobramycin (Nebcin) is administered by aerosol spray...
    it has proved to be more effective in reaching infected lung tissue than when
    administered through the traditional intravenous route., \"Cystic fibrosis (CF)
    is the most common inherited illness among Americans of northern and western
    European ancestery. It  occurs in people of all ethnic backgrounds and is the
    most common in Caucasians.. It occurs with approximately equal frequency in men
    and women. one in every 3000 children in the US are born with this disorder.
    The gene responsible for CF was identified in 1989 on human chromosome 7... and
    it encodes instructions for a protein of the body's exocrine glands. This defective
    gene transforms the protein (called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance
    regulator (CFTR) and causes it to produce a mucus too thick and too abundant
    for the body to excrete. The genetic instructions omit just one of the protein's
    1...480 constituent amino acids- a tiny glitch... but a devastating one that
    affects many different glands in the body... including the pancreas... sweat
    glands... and glands of the digestive and respiratory systems. All human cells
    (except red blood cells... eggs... and sperm) contain two copies of this gene...
    one inherited from each parent. CF results when both copies of the \"\"CF gene\"\"
    are abnormal. If one copy is abnormal and the other normla... an individual is
    said to be a carrier. Statisically... a child of two carrier parents has a 1-in-4
    chance of inheriting CF... a 1/4 chance of being completely free of the mutant
    gene... and a 1/2 chance of being a carrier... like their parents. The identification
    of the CF gene has enabled researchers to begin developing new approaches to
    diagnosis and treatment of the disease. A test is now available in which cells
    are swabbed from the inside of the cheek and then examined for the presence of
    defective genes. The presence of both normal and mutant CF genes indicated that
    the individual is a carrier... if only mutant genes are there... CF is indicated.
    DNAase (Dornase) is a naturally occurring enzyme that breaks down DNA molecules.
    Part of the reason the mucus that clogs the airways of people with CF is so thick
    and sticky is that it contains large molecules of DNA released by white blood
    cells as they die fighting chronic bacterial infection... making mucus even denser
    and more difficult to expel.\"------->   \r\nEmphysema, x, x, x, x, COPDs...
    which also include asthma and chronic bronchitis... can interfere with normal
    breathing. The predominant symptom of emphysema is shortness of breath and the
    feeling of not being able to get enough air during any kind of physical exertion. 
    A person with advanced emphysema may experience a near-constant state of breathlessness...
    chronic coughing and wheezing... and frequent discharge of sputum from the respiratory
    passages., x, x, Emphysema is a degenerative lung disease that usually develops
    after many years of exposure to cigarette smoke or other toxins that pollute
    the air. It is one of a group of lung diseases referred to as chronic obstructive
    pulmonary disease (COPD). COPDs... which also include asthma and chronic bronchitis...
    can interfere with normal breathing. The predominant symptom of emphysema is
    shortness of breath and the feeling of not being able to get enough air during
    any kind of physical exertion. In people with emphysema... damage to the alveoli
    (small air sacs in the lungs) causes the lungs to lose their elasticity. As a
    result... exhaling becomes difficult... and stal air remains trapped in the lungs...
    preventing the needed exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. A person with advanced
    emphysema may experience a near-constant state of breathlessness... chronic coughing
    and wheezing... and frequent discharge of sputum from the respiratory passages.
    Emphysema can also contribute to other health problems... such as lung infections
    and a condition called erythrocytosis... in which the blood contains abnormally
    high levels of red blood cells. Erythrocytosis can cause such symptoms as weakness...
    dizziness... fatigue... lightheadedness... headache... and vision problems. Most
    people who are diagnosed with emphysema are long-term smokers. Symptoms may not
    occur until middle age... when the individual's ability to exercise or do heavy
    work begins to decline... and a productive cough begins. The symptoms may be
    subtle at first... but worsen with time. In rare cases... emphysema is caused
    by a genetic condition that leads to a deficiency of a blood protein called alpha-1-antitrypsin.
    The overwhelming majority of cases... however... are related to smoking. Regular
    smoking... whether of tabacco or marijuana... causes chronic low-level inflammation
    of the lungs... which increases the chance of developing this progressive disease.------->  
    \r\nGerman Measles (Rubella), x, x, x, x, German measles mostly affects children...
    adolescents... and young adults. It initially causes swelling of the lymph glands
    in the neck and behind the ears. Other symptoms include coughing... fatigue...
    headache... mild fever... muscle aches... and stiffness... mainly in the neck.
    A pink rask often develops... usually starting on the face and neck and then
    spreading to the rest of the body. The rash typically lasts for about three days.
    The virus usually runs its course in five to seven days... and is generally not
    treated. A person who has had German measles has a lifetime immunity against
    the virus. The commincable period probably begins two to four days before the
    rash appears... and the virus most often disappears from the nose and throat
    by the time the rash on the body disappears... one to three days after the onset
    of the symptoms. However... because... because of the danger it poses to pregnant
    women. It should be considered contagious from one week before to the rash...
    to one week after the rash fades. , If necessary... catnip tea or garlic enemas
    can be used to lower fever. Clove and peppermint tea aid in relieveing symptoms.
    Take maitake... reishi... and shiitake mushrooms for boosting the body's immune
    system. Olive leaf extract is good for reducing symptoms and controlling the
    virus. Drink plenty of fluids. Rest until the rash and fever has disappeared.
    Antibiotics are uselless against viruses... so they are not called for the treatment.
    Extra care should be taken if a rash breaks out close to the eyes. Imm, Immunity
    to German measles can be determined by a blood test. Any woman who wishes to
    become pregant and who is not sure wheter she has achieved immunity to German
    measles should be tested and vaccinated... if neccesary., German measles... or
    rubella... is a contagious viral disease that generally produces mild symptoms
    but it is potentially dangerous to a fetus if a pregnant woman contracts the
    disease during the first trimester. Before a rubella vaccine was developed in
    the late 1960s... thousands of babies in the United States were born with severe
    birth defects because their mothers were exposed to the virus. Today... most
    children recieve a vaccine that protects against measles... mumps... and rubella...
    but the virus exists worldwide and outbreaks still occur sporadically... usually
    in large population areas.------->   \r\nHay Fever, x, x, x, x, \"Symptoms include

    and nervous irritability. Many of the symptoms of hay fever are similar to those
    of the common cold. However allergies cause a distinctive clear... thin nasal
    discarge... whereas secertions caused by colds usually become thick and yellow
    green as the illness progresses. Also... colds are often associated with mild

    a natural reaction to the presence of a foreign substance in the body. However...
    an offending sub\xAD stance need not enter the body to trigger an outbreak of
    hives. Merely coming into contact with various substances... such as pesticides...
    soaps... shampoos... hair sprays... residues from laundry products or dry cleaning
    chemicals on cloth\xAD ing... or any other of a vast array of other seemingly

    \nThe severity of a hives outbreak can vary from case to        \n\"\"case as
    well as from person to person. Some people can break out in hives if they merely
    touch a certain type of plant or bush; others may develop hives only with consid\xAD

    is a common com\xAD         \n\"\"plaint. There are many factors that can cause
    this annoying problem. Incontinence can be either acute or persistent. Acute
    incontinence is most often caused by an infection. Persistent incontinence develops
    over time and tends to last longer. There are several different types of persistent
    in\xAD continence... among them stress incontinence... urge inconti\xAD nence...
    functional incontinence... reflex incontinence... and total incontinence.\"\"        
    \n\"\"Stress incontinence is the most common bladder control problem. This is
    leakage that occurs when a person coughs... sneezes...laughs... lifts a heavy
    object... or otherwise increases pressure in the lower abdomen. The bladder is
    rarely com\xAD pletely emptied . Dribbling is more common than complete evacuation
    of the bladder. This problem is a result of weak\xAD ened pelvic muscles... which
    can be due to aging... obesity... and/or pregnancy.\"\"         \n\"\"Urge incontinence
    is the result of an overactive bladder. The detrusor muscle... which surrounds
    thebladder...may in\xAD voluntary contract and begin the flow of urine. Frequent
    urination is common with this type of incontinence... as is nocturnal urination...
    especially in men. Difficulty urinating may also be due to prostate inflammation.
    Possible under\xAD lying causes of urge incontinence includea history of pelvie
    inflammatory disease...abdominal surgery... stimulants such alcohol and coffee...
    and bladder infection. It may also be due to prostate problems.\"\"         \n\"\"Functional
    incontinence is characterized by an uncon\xAD trollableurge to empty the bladder
    before you can reach the bathroom . It can be caused by stress; changes in environ\xAD
    ment... such as having to stay in the hospital and not being able to get to the
    bathroom in time; and mobility restric\xAD tions. Some individuals are not aware
    when their bladders are full...and this loss of sensation can lead to urine leakage.
    Thisisreflex incontinence... and itis most bften due to spinal cord injury or
    other neurological impairment. Total incon\xAD tinence is the unpredictable lossof
    urine at all times.It can be caused by neurological dysfunction... abdominal

    Antibiotics are useless against viral illnesses like in\xAD fluenza. The best
    way to get rid of the flu or any other in\xAD fectious illness is to attack it
    head-on by strengthening the immune system. The thymus and the adrenal glands
    are the power seat of the immune system. When the body is getting sick... or
    is already sick... it is under stress... and stress taxesthe immune system. Researchers
    have linked vulner\xAD ability to colds and flu to psychological stress.\"\"    
    \n\"\"0 Zanamivir (Relenza)... an inhaled antiviral drug...battles flu symptoms
    and shortens the duration of the illness. Ithas also been shown tobeeffective
    in preventing the flu inboth strains of influenza. Another medication... oseltamivir
    (Tam\xAD iflu) has shown comparable results. Both of these medica\xAD tions may
    be beneficial for people with immune system problems.\"\"     \n\"\"0 We do not
    recommend flu shots in general. Their use\xAD fulness is questionable... and
    the side effects may be worse than the flu would be. Enhancement of immune function
    is preferable--and safer. Ifyou a:re allergic to eggs or chicken... you should
    definitely avoid flu shots...as the vaccine is pro\xAD d.uced from chicken embryos.\"\"

    a highly contagious\"\"     \n\"\"viral infection of the upper respiratory tract.
    There are two types of influenza viruses... designated type A and type B... that
    cause this acute infection of the throat... nose...bronchial tubes... lungs...
    and middle ear. The virus enters the body's airways through mucous membranes
    in the nose... eyes... or mouth. Because this illness can be spread easily by
    cough\xAD ing and sneezing... influenza epidemics are very common... especially
    in winter. During an epidemic... from 25 to more than 50 percent of the population
    can become infected. The flu isunpredictable and can strike anyone...at any age.
    More than 200 different individual strains of virus can cause colds and flu...
    and strains of these viruses are constantly changing... so vaccinations against
    influenza have been only partly successful in preventing outbreaks of the disease.\"\"    
    \n\"\"The symptoms of influenza begin much like those of the common cold-body
    aches... cough... fatigue... headache... and hot and cold sweats. In many cases...
    a fever develops... and you may feel unbearably hot one moment and chilled and
    shaking the next. Most influenza sufferers have a dry throat and cough. Nausea
    and vomiting may occur as well. Often... a person with U1e flu is so weak and
    so uncomfortable that he or she does not feel like eating or doing anything else.
    Colds last for about one week to ten days... on average... but the flu lasts
    longer-up to twelve days or more... followed by a week or more of residual coughing
    and fatigue.\"\"     \n\"\"Influenza is rarely dangerous in healthy adults sixty
    years of age or younger... but it does make a person more susceptible to pneumonia...ear
    infections... and sinus trouble. The disease is linked to 20...000 deaths in
    the United States every year. Among people sixty-five or older...serious respi\xAD
    ratory infections such as influenza and pneumonia are the fifth leading cause
    of death...so the flu isclearly a serious in\xAD fection for older people.High-risk

    \nRECOMMENDATIONS        \n\"\"0 Ifyou suspect that you or a member of your family
    has measles... seeyour health care provider. Thisis important for a correct diagnosis
    and to prevent serious complications. 0 Drink plenty of fluids such as water...

    foods.        \n\"\"0 To help relieve coughing...mix 1tablespoon lemon ju ice
    and 2 tablespoons honey with % cup water. Take as needed. 0 To alleviate itching...
    place 1/2 cup of baking soda in a bathtubful of lukewarm water and soak in the
    bath until the itching decreases. Gently applying witch hazel to the af\xAD fected
    area also will help to ease thediscomfort and itching associated with the rash.\"\"       
    \nSC        \nMemory Problems        \n0 Try using homeopathic remedies to ease
    symptoms.        \nAconitum napellu s (homeopathic monkshood) is the home\xAD
    opathic version of vitamin C in that it is helpful in the ini\xAD tial stage
    of measles. Ferrum phosphoricum (homeopathic phosophate of iron) is beneficial
    for mild infections.        \n0 Rest until the rash and fever have disappeared.       
    \n0 Keep the lights dim. Do not read or watch television while your eyes are
    sensitive to light.        \n0 Do not send a child who hashad measles to school
    until seven to nine days after the fever and rash have disap\xAD peared.       
    \nCONSIDERATIONS        \n\"\"0 Doctors generally recommend that children receive
    two measles vaccinations... the first at the age of about fif\xAD teen months
    and the second either before entering school or at approximately twelve years
    of age. A second vaccination is now considered necessary because there have been
    out\xAD breaks of measles among college students who received a single immunization
    in childhood. However... certain indi\xAD viduals should not be immunized against
    measles... includ\xAD ing pregnant women and anyone who has cancer or a weakened
    immune system... is on cortisone or anticancer drugs... is undergoing radiation
    therapy... or has any type of illness with fever. People who are allergic to
    eggs should mention this to their physicians prior to having the vaccine. A person
    who has had and recovered from measles does not require immunization;a single
    attack of measles gives lifelong immunity to the disease.\"\"        \n\"\"0
    Short-term... high doses of vitamin A have been used to lessen the severity and
    complications of measles. Since high doses of vitamin A can be toxic... high
    dosages of this vita\xAD min should be taken only for brief periods (two weeks
    or less) and should be monitored very carefully.\"\"        \n\"\"0 Antibiotics

    Sev\xAD eral days later... Koplik's spots (tiny red spots with white centers)

    rash erupts on the forehead and ears. Over a period of five to seven days...
    the rash spreads to all parts of the body.\"\"        \n\"\"Tn previously healthy
    children... measles usually runs its course in about ten days. However... it
    can be followed by a number of complications...some of them potentially serious.
    These include middle ear infection (especially in children with a history of

    and even... in rare cases... en\xAD cephalitis or meningitis. Adults who develop
    measles tend to suffer more serious cases of the disease than children do. Unless
    otherwise specified... the dosages recommended here are for adults. For a child
    between the ages of twelve and seventeen... reduce the dose to three-quarters

    Slurred speech... distorted vision...or numbness or tingling in part of the body.\"\"     
    \nThese can be signs of more serious disorders.      \nJ      \nPart Two    THE
    DISORDERS      \nCONSIDERATIONS      \n\"\"0 Researchers believe many migraine
    attacks are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain. Levels of the brain chemical
    serotonin drop during a headache. This triggers an impulse along the trigeminal
    nerve to blood vessels in the meninges...the brain's outer covering. In the meninges...
    the blood vessels become inflamed and swollen. The result is a headache.\"\"     
    \n\"\"0 Migraine headaches in women may result from hor\xAD monal changes during
    the menstrual cycle. Af ter meno\xAD pause... the headaches usually decrease.\"\"     
    \n0 Women who suffer from migraines may benefit from the use of natural progesterone
    cream.      \n\"\"0 A study reported in the British medical journal The Lancet
    found that when allergenic  foods were eliminated from the diets of migraine
    sufferers... as many as 93 percent of them found relief. ( See ALLERGIES in Part
    Two.)\"\"      \n0 Caffeine has been found to be a very safe and effective method
    for increasing pain relief. Caffeine taken with over\xAD the-counter pain relievers
    has been shown to reduce headache pain by up to 40 percent.      \n\"\"0 Researchers
    in France have identified a gene linked to a rare... severe type of migraine
    called f amilial hemiplegic mi\xAD graine.\"\"      \n0 Music has a calming effect
    and can help to relieve mi\xAD graines. ( See MUSIC AND SOUND THERAPY in Part
    Three.)      \n\"\"0 Some find migraine relief by taking lecithin (a soybean
    derivative). In one study... those who took between three and six 1...200-milligram
    capsules when they felt a headache coming on had fewer...milder migraine attacks.\"\"     
    \n0 Acupuncture and acupressure have helped many peo\xAD ple control the pain
    of migraines.      \n\"\"0 A study on the herb feverfew conducted at the Univer\xAD
    sity of Nottingham in England found that participantswho took the herb got an
    average of 24 percent fewer migraines than those who did not... and they also
    found that vomiting was reduced... with no side effects.\"\"      \n\"\"0 The
    drug sumatriptan (Imitrex) relieves acute migraine attacks by increasing the
    amount of serotonin in the brain. In clinical studies... 82 percent of peoplewith
    migraines who took sumatriptan improved within two hours of treatment. This drug
    may be administered by injection... orally... or as a nasal spray. Itcan be effective...
    but it can also cause side ef\xAD fects... including dizziness... drowsiness...anxiety...
    and malaise. Naratriptan (Amerge)... rizatripta n (Maxalt)... and zolmitrip\xAD
    tan (Zomig) are drugs that are similar to sumatriptan. Di\xAD hydroergotamine
    (DHE or Migranal) is a different type of migraine drug available in spray form.
    Midrin... a combina\xAD tion drug... and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
    (NSAIDs) are also prescribed for migraine. These drugs are not appropriate for
    everyone. Because they have the po\xAD tential to cause coronary artery constriction...
    they should not be taken by people with ischemic heart disease (angina\"\"     
    \ns      \nMononucleosis      \nor a history of heart attack). Treatment with
    sumatriptan      \n\"\"may result in a rise in blood pressure... so people with
    un\xAD controlled hypertension should not use it. You should al\xAD ways discuss
    potential side effects of any prescription medication with your physician.\"\"     
    \n\"\"0 Antidepressants are sometimes prescribed for people who get migraines.
    These include amitriptyline (Elavil... Endep) and nortriptyline. They are used
    as a preventive rather than as therapy for an acute attack. Other medica\xAD
    tions sometimes used as preventives include diazepam (Valium)... methysergide
    (Sansert)... and propranolol (In\xAD deral).\"\"      \n0 For names and addresses

    \n\"\"not be accompanied by nausea... visual disturbances... and other symptoms.
    An estimated 28 million people in the United States suffer &om migraine headaches.
    Many more women than men suffer from this condition. Migraines are one of the
    most severe types of headache.\"\"      \n\"\"Traditional research has described
    migraines as vascular headaches involving excessive dilation or contraction of
    the brain's blood vessels. More recent current research gives other clues. Single
    photon emission computerized tomog\xAD raphy (SPECT) scanning indicates that
    the inflammation in\xAD volved in migraines is most noticable in the meninges.
    These are three membranes-the dura... the arachnoid...and the very inner layer
    of membrane separated from the other two by cerebrospinal fluid... called the
    pia-that surround the brain and spinal cord. However... it is not the inflamma\xAD
    tion that leads to the pain... but rather abnormal nerve activ\xAD ity. Stimulation
    of the trigeminal nerve... which goes from the brain to the head and face...appears
    to trigger the release of substances known as calcitonin gene-related peptides
    (CGRP)... which both induce inflammation and send mes\xAD sages to pain receptors
    in the meninges. Some researchers liken migraines in many ways to meningitis...
    another con\xAD dition affecting the meninges... noting that with meningitis...
    the symptoms are very similar-headache... nausea... and sensitivity to light.
    Meningitis... however... is caused by viral or bacterial infection... while much
    more research needs to be conducted before the underlying cause of migraines
    is known.\"\"      \n\"\"Migraines may occur anywhere from once a week to once
    or twice a year... and they often run in families. One factor behind the higher
    incidence of migraine in women may be fluctuations in the level of the hormone
    estrogen; women typically get migraines around the time of men\xAD struation...
    when estrogen levels are low. Migraines occur most often in people between the
    ages of twenty and thirty-five... and tend to decline with age. However... chil\xAD
    dren too can suffer from migraines. In children... migraine pain tends to be
    more diff use... rather than localized. Mi\xAD graine can first show up in childhood
    not as headaches... but as colic... periodic abdominal pains... vomiting... dizzi\xAD
    ness... and severe motion sickness.There are usually five phases in a migraine:\"\"

    as a free-form amino acid complex. Amino acids are \n\nthe building block of
    proteins. Soy is an excellent source of \n\nnondairy protein. \n\nDrink plenty
    of fresh juices. Liquids help to thin the \n\nlung secretions. Fast on pure juices...
    fresh lemon juice... and \n\ndistilled water. (See FASTING and JUICING... both
    in Part \n\nThree.) \n\nInclude \"\"green drinks\"\" in your diet or take chlorophyll

    to others... dispose \n\nof secretions properly. Sneeze and/or cough into dispos-
    \n\nable tissues. Hush used tissues to discard them. \n\n[2 Children with pneumonia
    have to be carefully moni- \n\ntored. If you suspect that your child might have
    pneumo- \n\nnia... seek medical advice immediately. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS \n\n[2
    Vitamin Ais necessary for maintaining the health of the \n\nlining of the respiratory
    passages. A deficiency of this vita- \n\nmin increases susceptibility to respiratory
    infections... which \n\nin turn can lead to pneumonia. \n\nPneumococcal vaccine
    provides protection against \n\nmore than twenty different strains of microorganisms
    that \n\ncan cause pneumonia. It is recommended for anyone with- \n\nout a spleen...
    anyone with a chronic disease (especially dis- \n\neases that affect the lungs)...
    and everyone over the age of \n\nsixty-five. \n\nA urine test for Streptococcus
    pneumoniae takes fifteen \n\nminutes to perform... It is more efficient than
    diagnosis from \n\nmucus... blood... or saliva. \n\nThe use of antibiotics for
    minor infections such as colds \n\nmay lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant
    bacte- \n\nria in the upper airway... which can cause pneumonia. \n\nSee also
    INFLUENZA and COMMON COLD... both in Part \n\nTwo. \n\n\", x, \"\nPneumonia is
    a serious infection of the lungs that can be \n\ncaused by any of a number of
    different infectious agents... in- \n\ncluding viruses... bacteria... fungi...
    protozoa... and my- \n\ncoplasma. The infection causes tiny air sacs in the lung
    area \n\nto become inflamed and filled with mucus and pus... in- \n\nhibiting
    oxygen from reaching the blood... Lobar pneumonia \n\naffects only a section...
    or lobe... of one lung. Bronchial pneu- \n\nmotlia affects portions of both lungs...
    Although symptoms \n\ncan vary in intensity... they usually include fever...
    chills... \n\ncough... bloody sputum... muscle aches... fatigue... sore throat...

    \nPneumonia \n\nPneumonia is typically preceded by an upper respira- \n\ntory
    infection such as a cold... influenza... or measles. Factors \n\nthat increase
    the risk of pneumonia include being either \n\nunder one year or over sixty years
    of age... a weakened \n\nimmune system... cardiovascular disease... diabetes...
    HIV in- \n\nfection... seizure or stroke... aspiration under anesthesia... \n\nalcoholism...
    smoking... kidney failure... sickle cell disease... \n\nmalnutrition... foreign
    bodies in the respiratory passages... \n\nexposure to chemical irritants... and
    even allergies. \n\nBacterial pneumonia can be very dangerous and may \n\ncome
    on either suddenly or gradually... usually as a compli- \n\ncation of some other
    health problem such as respiratory dis- \n\nease... a weakened immune system...
    or viral infection. Older \n\nadults... young children... alcoholics... and people
    who have \n\njust undergone surgery are also at risk. Streptococcus pneu- \n\nmoniae
    is the most common cause of bacterial pneumonia. \n\nSymptoms usually include
    shaking... chills... and a high tem- \n\nperature. The cough is dry at first.
    Then a rust-colored spu- \n\ntum is produced... and breathing becomes rapid and
    \n\nlabored. Chest pain that worsens upon inhalation... abdom- \n\ninal pain...
    and fatigue are also common. This type of pneu- \n\nmonia is unlikely to spread
    from one person to another. \n\nViral pneumonia is more variable in course and
    severity. \n\nIt can come on suddenly or gradually... and symptoms\u2014 \n\nwhich
    are much the same as those of bacterial pneumo- \n\nnia\u2014can be mild... severe...
    or anywhere in between. It is less \n\nserious than bacterial pneumonia... but
    if not cared for prop- \n\nerly... a second... bacterial pneumonia infection
    can set in. \n\nFungal pneumonia... espedally Pneumocystis carinii pneu- \n\nmonia
    (PCP)... is much less common than either the bacter- \n\nial or viral variety...
    and is often associated with a weakened \n\nor suppressed immune system. People
    with HIV... AIDS... or \n\ncertain types of cancer... or who are taking immunosuppres-
    \n\nsive drugs following organ transplantation... are most likely \n\nto be affected.
    \n\nMycoplasma pneumonia... or \"\"walking pneumonia...\"\" is \n\ncaused by
    an agent that is unclassified but appears to be \n\nboth bacterium and virus...
    This form of pneumonia usually \n\naffects people under forty. The symptoms tend
    to be less se- \n\nvere than those of viral or bacterial pneumonia and include
    \n\na cough that is spasmodic... along with chills and a fever. \n\nInfants can
    contract pneumonia due to a Chlamydia tra- \n\nchomatis infection transferred
    to the child during birth. \n\nChildhood pneumonia can also be caused by the
    same bac- \n\nteria that cause whooping cough. \n\nYoung children (especially
    infants)... older adults... and \n\npeople who have compromised immune systems
    are very \n\nvunerable to the potentially life-threatening effects of this \n\nillness.
    Pneumonia is now the fifth leading cause of death \n\nin the United States. No
    matter what the cause... pneumonia \n\nusually leaves the sufferer with weakness
    that persists for \n\nfour to eight weeks after the acute phase of the infection
    has \n\nresolved. \n\nUnless otherwise specified... the dosages recommended \n\nhere

    \n\nTHE DISORDERS Part \n\nRose hips are a good source of vitamin C. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS
    \n\nEat a diet consisting of 75 percent raw foods. \n\nDrink plenty of distilled
    water and fresh vegetable and \n\nfruit juices. Also consume plenty of hot liquids
    such as \n\nsoups and herbal teas. These help the mucus to flow... re- \n\nlieving
    congestion and sinus pressure. Adding cayenne \n\npepper... garlic... ginger...
    horseradish... and raw onion to soups \n\nor teas may bring even faster relief.
    \n\nEliminate sugar from your diet. Reduce your salt \n\nintake. \n\nDo not eat
    dairy foods... except for low-fat soured prod- \n\nucts like yogurt and cottage
    cheese. Dairy products increase \n\nmucus formation. \n\nGo on a cleansing fast.
    (See FASTINC in Part Three.) \n\nMix a solution of 1 cup warm water... 1/2 teaspoon
    of sea \n\nsalt... and a pinch of bicarbonate of soda. Use a squeeze \n\nspray
    bottle (available over the counter in drugstores) or an \n\neyedropper to instill
    the solution in the nostrils... one side at \n\na time. Repeat this procedure
    three or four times a day as \n\nnecessary for relief from stuffiness. \n\n[2
    Try using a menthol or eucalyptus pack applied over \n\nthe sinuses to relieve
    pain and swelling. Stop if the packs \n\ncause irritation... \n\nUse a vaporizer
    to ease breathing and clear secretions. \n\nUse steam inhalations to promote
    drainage and ease \n\npressure. Boil a pot of water and add a few drops of euca-
    \n\nlyptus oil or rosemary oil... Remove the pot from the heat \n\nand lean your
    face over it at a distance of about 6 inches \n\nto inhale the steam. (Be careful
    not to get so close that irri- \n\ntation or scalding results.) Place a towel
    over your head \n\nto capture the steam and breathe in deeply. Do this several
    \n\ntimes dailv for five to ten minutes at a time. Or simply \n\ntake a hot shower
    to help relieve the pain and pressure of \n\nsinusitis. \n\nYou can also use
    a Neti pot... a small teapot-like device es- \n\npecially designed for nasal
    irrigation. They are available in \n\nmany health food stores. Fill the pot with
    sea salt and water \n\n(2 teaspoons salt to one pint water) and rinse out your
    nose \n\nwith this solution. This should reduce inflammation and \n\ncongestion.
    \n\n[2 Use warm compresses or ice packs to help relieve pain \n\n(experiment
    to see which works best for you). \n\nTry homeopathic remedies to alleviate symptoms.
    Bel- \n\nladonna is good for infections accompanied by fever and \n\npain in
    the face and forehead. Kali bichromicum is useful if \n\nthere is an overabundance
    of mucus in the throat. \n\nIf you are taking antibiotics for a sinus infection...
    be sure \n\nto add an acidophilus supplement to your program. Do not \n\ntake
    the acidophilus and the antibiotic at the same time. \n\nIf you use decongestants...
    use them only as directed and \n\n\nPart Two THE DISORDERS \n\nfor the prescribed
    amount of time. If possible... avoid using \n\nnose drops and sprays. These can
    become addictive and \n\ninterfere with normal sinus function. In addition...
    drops \n\nand sprays... as well as inhalers... can shrink blood vessels in \n\nthe
    nose... eventually causing the vessels to weaken. More- \n\nover... withdrawal
    from decongestants can cause a rebound \n\neffect... in which the swelling becomes
    worse after use is \n\ndiscontinued than it was to begin with. They can also
    \n\ncause dangerous elevations in blood pressure. Do not use \n\nthese medications
    if you have high blood pressure or heart \n\nproblems. \n\nIf sinusitis causes
    your eyes to become swollen... red... or \n\nitchy... or to begin tearing...
    try a product called OcuDyne. \n\nMade by NutriCology... this is a complex containing
    vita- \n\nmins... minerals... antioxidants... key amino acids... active bio-
    \n\nflavonoids... and the herbs bilberry and ginkgo biloba to \n\nprotect the
    eyes and boost immune function. \n\nDo not use force when blowing your nose...
    as this forces \n\nmucus back into the sinus cavities. Instead... draw secretions
    \n\nto the back of the throat by sniffing... then expel them. \n\nDo not smoke...
    and avoid secondhand smoke. If you \n\nlive in a smoggy area... consider getting
    an air purifier or \n\nmoving to a less polluted area. The Living Air XL-15 from
    \n\nAlpine Industries is an air purification unit for home use. \n\nAir Supply
    from Wein Products is a personal air purifier. \n\nWorn around the neck... it
    sets up a defensive shield against \n\nmicroorganisms and microparticles in the
    air wherever \n\nyou go. \n\nIf you notice swelling around the eyes... consult
    your \n\nphysician. This is a serious sign. \n\nHave regular dental examinations.
    Infections in the \n\nmouth can easily spread to the sinuses. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS
    \n\nIf nasal secretions turn clear after a week... you probably \n\ndo not have
    an infection; if the mucus is greenish or yel- \n\nlowish... you probably do...
    If secretions are clear and you \n\nhave no other symptoms of a cold... you probably
    have \n\nallergies. \n\nAntibiotics may be necessary to clear a bacterial infec-
    \n\ntion. Always take antibiotics for the full course prescribed... \n\neven
    if symptoms seem to improve earlier. Stopping pre- \n\nmaturely can lead to antibiotic-resistant
    bacteria and a \n\nworse infection. \n\nSometimes physicians prescribe antibiotics
    even if they \n\ncannot confirm a bacterial infection. The reasoning for this
    \n\nis that it is very difficult to ascertain whether bacteria are \n\ncausing
    the sinusi\xE5s... and that it may be worth it to prevent \n\na bacterial infection
    from appearing later. As with any med- \n\nication... it is important to know
    the benefits... risks... and costs \n\nof using and of not using an antibiotic.
    \n\nIf sinus trouble is chronic and severe... and medication \n\nfails to relieve
    it... surgery may be needed to drain the si- \n\nSkin Cancer \n\nnuses... not
    only to relieve discomfort but to guard against \n\nserious consequences. \n\nEndoscopic
    surgery... a treatment sometimes recom- \n\nmended for chronic... severe sinusitis...
    clears nasal passages \n\nwithout external incisions or scars. The procedure
    can be \n\nperformed using local anesthesia and results in minimal \n\npain and
    swelling. \n\nWhile they are uncommon... polyps and benign cysts \n\nthat retain
    mucus can develop in the sinuses... especially in \n\nthe large maxillary or
    frontal sinuses. Intrusive or malig- \n\nnant growths require surgical removal.
    \n\nAnyone suffering from unremitting sinusitis should \n\nconsult a health care
    provider to rule out an underlying \n\nimmune dysfunction. In a University of
    Miami study... 50 \n\npercent of chronic sinusitis patients were found to be
    suf\u201E \n\nfering from immunological disorders.\n\", x, \"Sinusitis is an
    inflammation of the nasal sinuses. There are \n\nsinuses located above the eyes
    (frontal sinuses); to either \n\n624 \n\nPart Two THE DISORDERS \n\nside of the
    nose... inside the cheekbones (maxillary sinuses); \n\nbehind the bridge of the
    nose (sphenoid sinuses); and in the \n\nupper nose (ethmoid sinuses). Sinuses
    are air-filled pockets \n\nin the skull that are connected to the nose and throat
    by pas- \n\nsages designed to drain away mucus. The sinuses are the \n\nfirst
    line of defense in protecting the lungs against infection. \n\nMost cases of
    sinusitis affect the frontal and/or maxillary \n\nsinuses... but any or all of
    the sinuses may be involved... and \n\neach individual tends to have problems
    with a particular \n\nset of sinuses. If the sinuses are too small or poorly
    posi- \n\ntioned to handle the volume of mucus produced... they can \n\nbecome
    clogged. Pressure in the sinuses increases... causing \n\npain. Sinuses that
    are clogged for a long time seem to invite \n\ninfection. \n\nSinusitis can be
    either acute or chronic. Acute sinusi\xFCs is \n\nfrequently caused by bacterial
    or viral infections of the nose... \n\nthroat... and upper respiratory tract...
    such as the common \n\ncold. More than 50 percent of all cases of sinusitis are
    caused \n\nby bacteria. Air travel also can lead to acute inflammation of \n\nthe
    sinuses... because of changes in air pressure. Chronic si- \n\nnusitis problems
    may be caused by small growths in the \n\nnose... injury of the nasal bones...
    air pollution... dental compli- \n\ncations... emotional stress... smoking...
    and exposute to irritant \n\nfumes and smells. Allergic sinusitis may be caused
    by hay \n\nfever or food allergies. especially allergies to milk and dairy \n\nproducts.
    People with compromised immune systems are \n\nsusceptible to fungal sinusitis...
    a potentially dangerous con- \n\ndition that requires aggressive treatment. \n\nSymptoms
    of sinusitis include fever (usually low-grade... \n\nbut higher in some cases)...
    cough... headache... earache... \n\ntoothache... facial pain... cranial pressure...
    difficulty breathing \n\nthrough the nose... loss of the sense of smell... and
    tenderness \n\nover the forehead and cheekbones. If tapping the forehead \n\njust
    over the eyes... the cheekbones... or the area around the \n\nbridge of the nose
    causes pain... the sinuses may be infected. \n\nSometimes sinusitis produces
    facial swelling followed by a \n\nstuffy nose and thick discharge of mucus. The
    symptoms \n\nsuffered by those with sinusitis can have other unpleasant \n\neffects.

    from Derma-E Products contains \n\nchamomile... tea tree oil... and vitamin E.
    It offers quick relief \n\nof skin irritation. \n\nSoak a washcloth in malva
    tea and apply it as a warm \n\ncompress to the infected area to reduce inflammation...
    \n\nOat straw may be used topically in a bath to reduce \n\nsymptoms... especially
    inflammation and itching. \n\nOlive leaf extract has healing properties for the
    skin. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\nFor quick relief of itching and inflammation...
    soak a \n\nclean cloth in cool water (or... for even greater soothing ef- \n\nfeet...
    in comfrey tea that has cooled)... wring it out... and apply \n\nit to the affected
    area far ten minutes. Repeat this procedure \n\nas often as necessary for relief.
    \n\n634 \n\nTHE DISORDERS Part Two \n\nTake lukewarm showers instead of baths...
    and try not to \n\nshower every day during the duration of the rash. Also \n\navoid
    using the same washcloth... sponge... or shower pouf \n\neach time you shower...
    as bacteria and fungi can grow in \n\nthese moist areas. \n\nWhenever possible...
    use hypoallergenic skin care prod- \n\nucts... deodorants... shaving creams...
    soaps... hair products... \n\ncosmetics... household products... and laundry
    detergents. \n\nKeep in mind... however... that hypoallergenic means only that
    \n\na product is not likely to cause allergies; not that it will not. \n\nAlso...
    when choosing products... look for \"\"fragrance-free\"\" \n\nformulas rather
    than an \"\"unscented\"\" one. \n\nWear cool... loose clothing. Next to the skin...
    cotton is \n\nbest. \n\nAvoid prolonged contact with known skin irritants in-
    \n\nduding chemicals... dust... direct sunlight... and water. \n\nRadiation and
    chemotherapy treatments can cause skin \n\nto become more sensitive to allergens
    and irritants. Occa- \n\nsionally... radiation can also cause the skin to thin...
    lose elas- \n\nticity... and become lighter or darker in color. Emollients and
    \n\nhigh-SPF sunscreens should be used generously on affected \n\nareas. \n\nMany
    medications cause skin rashes in people when \n\nthey are exposed to sunlight.
    If your medication causes \n\nphotosensitivity... ask your doctor if there are
    any alterna- \n\ntives. \n\nSee Common Types of Rashes on page 633 to help you
    \n\nidentify possible causes of a rash... and refer to the appro- \n\npriate
    sections in Part Two for advice on treatment. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS \n\nFour of
    the most serious diseases in which skin rash is \n\nan early warning signal are
    Rocky Mountain spotted fever... \n\nmeningococcal disease... staphylococcal toxic
    shock syn- \n\ndrome... and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. \n\nSkin rashes
    in children are often caused by food aller- \n\nBies... especially to chocolate...
    dairy products... eggs... peanuts... \n\nmilk... wheat... fish... chicken...
    pork... or beef. Some experts esti- \n\nmate that allergies to eggs... peanuts...
    and milk account for as \n\nmany as 75 percent of all skin rashes in children-
    \n\nMany doctors recommend hydrocortisone cream for \n\nminor irritations...
    poison ivy... itchy insect bites... and diaper \n\nrash. The use of antihistamines
    and antibiotics are also \n\ncommon treatmen ts prescribed by doctors for various
    types \n\nof rashes. In severe cases... a doctor may prescribe an oral \n\nsteroid
    (such as prednisone... prednisolone... or hydrocorti- \n\nsone) or the use of
    phototherapy (procedures involve the \n\nuse of ultraviolet radiation)... \n\nAllergy
    testing is advised... particularly for persistent \n\nrashes... (See ALLERGIES

    of foreign sub- \n\nstances that exist in our environment. It also functions
    as a \n\nmeans of excreting toxins and other substances from the \n\nbody...

    Most common in children. \n\nThere are several types of dermatitis... including
    atopic dermatitis... nummular dermatitis... seborrheic \n\ndermatitis... and
    hand dermatitis. General features include patches of scaling... flaking... and
    thickening \n\nskin that may appear anywhere on the body. Skin color in the affected
    area may change. Itching is \n\ncommon. One type of dermatitis causes round lesions
    on the limbs. \n\nA flat pink or red rash... with possible swelling and/or itching.
    \n\nMoist... possibly itchy... red patches that may appear anywhere on the body...
    but are most common in \n\nareas where skin surfaces rub together. In babies...
    an inflamed... shiny diaper rash. \n\nPainful fluid-filled blisters that erupt

    suddenly and can take the form of patches of tiny... goosebump-like spots \n\nor
    red... itchy welts that cover significant areas of the body\u2014or anything
    in between. \n\nA red... circular lesion that gradually expands as the center
    appears to clear up. This may be followed \n\nby a rash composed of small raised
    bumps on the torso. The rash may or may not be accompanied \n\nby flu-like symptoms
    of fever... chills... and nausea. \n\nA raised red rash that usually begins on
    the forehead and ears and spreads to the rest of the body. \n\nThe rash usually
    follows several days of viral symptoms including fever... cough... sneezing...

    \n\nand bran. Also consume yellow and deep-orange vegeta- \n\nbles such as carrots...
    pumpkin... squash... and yams... Apples... \n\nberries... Brazil nuts... cantaloupe...
    cherries... grapes... legumes \n\n(including chickpeas... lentils... and red
    beans)... and plums are \n\nalso helpful. \n\nEat onions and garlic... or take
    garlic in supplement \n\nform. \n\nDrink fresh carrot juice daily as a preventive
    measure \n\nagainst lung cancer. Also drink fresh beet juice (made from \n\nboth
    the roots and the greens) and asparagus juice. All \n\ndark-colored juices are
    good... as are black currants. Also \n\nbeneficial is apple juice... if it is
    fresh. Drink fruit juices in the \n\nmorning and vegetable juices in the afternoon.
    \n\nCook all sprouts slightly except for alfalfa sprouts... \n\nwhich should
    be eaten raw. \n\nDo not consume junk foods... processed refined foods... \n\nsaturated
    fats... salt... sugar... or white flour. Instead of salt... use \n\na kelp or
    potassium substitute. If you must... use a small \n\namount of blackstrap molasses
    or pure maple syrup as a \n\nnatural sweetener in place of sugar. Use whole wheat
    or rye \n\ninstead of white flour. Eliminate alcohol... coffee... and all teas
    \n\nexcept for herbal teas. \n\nDo not eat any animal protein except for broiled
    fish \n\n(up to three servings per week). Never eat luncheon meat... \n\nhot
    dogs... or smoked or cured meats. Limit your consump- \n\ntion of dairy products
    to a little low-fat yogurt... kefir... or raw \n\ncheese on an occasional basis.
    \n\nDo not eat any peanuts. Limit... but do not eliminate al- \n\ntogether...
    your intake of soybean products; they contain en- \n\nzyme inhibitors. \n\nKeep
    in mind that the acute craving for a cigarette \n\nusually lasts only three to
    five minutes. Focusing on this \n\nfact may make it easier to wait it out. Also
    remember that it \n\ngets easier and easier as time goes by. When cravings strike...
    \n\ntry taking a walk... doing some sit-ups... or engaging in any \n\nactivity
    that can momentarily take your mind off cigarettes. \n\nTo accelerate toxin elimination...
    see FASTM; in Part \n\nThree... and follow the proyam. \n\nTake coffee enemas
    daily. Use cleansing enemas with \n\nlemon and water or garlic and water two
    or three times \n\nweekly. (See ENEMAS in Part Three.) \n\nDrink spring or steam-distilled
    water only. \n\nAs much as possible... avoid stress. \n\nIf you take any medications...
    consult with your physi- \n\ncian about the possible need for an adjushnent in
    dosage \n\nafter you quit smoking. Tobacco alters the absorption and \n\nutilization
    of many medications... including insulin... asthma \n\ndrugs... and certain antidepressants...
    blood pressure medica- \n\ntions... and painkillers. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS \n\nThe
    difficulty of quitting appears to be related less to \n\n637 \n\nSnakebite \n\nhow
    many packs a day you smoke than to how early in life \n\nyou started smoking.
    \n\n[Z Many people have been successful in the quest to stop \n\nsmoking by going
    on a fast using only live juices and qual- \n\nity steam-distilled water. A live
    juice fast can quickly re- \n\nmove nicotine and other damaging chemicals from
    the \n\nbody. Adhering to a five-day live juice fast can have amaz- \n\ning effects.

    \n\nAlack of beta-carotene and the B-complex vitamins has \n\nbeen linked to
    lung and throat cancer. \n\nA study cosponsored by the British and Norwegian
    \n\ngovernments found that DNA taken from the lungs of fe- \n\nmale smokers showed
    significantly more damage than that \n\ntaken from men. DNA damage is a marker
    of increased can- \n\ncer risk. \n\nReseamh at the University of Indiana found
    that people \n\nwho drank six cups of tea a day were protected from the \n\ntoxic
    effects cigarette smoke has on the lungs by up to 50 \n\npercent. \n\nResearch
    at the University of Toronto suggests that a \n\ndrug called methoxsalen (8-MOP...
    Oxsoralen-Ultra)... some- \n\ntimes used to treat psoriasis... may help a smoker
    reduce the \n\nnumber of cigarettes he or she smokes by blocking an en- \n\nzyme
    that causes the bodv to metabolize nicotine more \n\nquickly. \n\nSmoking a pack
    of cigarettes a day or more friples the \n\nrisk of needing surgery for a herniated
    disk... but quitting \n\nsmoking reduces that risk... according to researchers
    at the \n\nMedical College of Wisconsin. \n\nAccording to a study reported in
    the Archives of Inter- \n\nnai Medicine... smoking increases the risk of developing
    \n\nleukemia by 30 percent. \n\nThere are alternative sources of nicotine for
    those who \n\nwish to quit smoking. They are available either in trans\xBB \n\ndermal
    patch form... as chewing gum... and as nasal sprays \n\nand inhalers. Some of
    these are available over the counter... \n\nwhile others require a prescription.
    \n\nBuproprion (Zyban) is an antidepressant that acts on \n\nthe brain in the
    same manner as nicotine. It can help some \n\npeople to stop smoking. ff you
    are concerned about gaining \n\nweight after you quit... buproprion may help
    limit the \n\namount of weight you put on. \n\nA diagnostic procedure called
    a sputum cytology test \n\ncan sometimes detect the presence of cancer before
    there \n\nare symptoms and before other tests show the disease. In \n\nthis test...
    sputum coughed up from the lungs and the \n\nbronchial tubes is examined for
    signs of tumor cells. \n\nThere are many different strategies for overcoming
    \n\nsmoking dependency. The secret to success may be finding \n\nthe approach

    Phillips (Avery Publishing Group... 1993)... is a \n\ncomprehensive and detailed
    guide to the many and varied \n\nstrategies that have helped people to break
    the smoking \n\nhabit. There are also a number of organizations that can \n\nprovide

    substance \n\nfor centuries. It has been ingested by various means... in- \n\ncluding

    raising the blood pressure and heart rate. Nicotine \n\nalso affects the overall

    in the muscles... and \n\nthe levels of certain hormones. These and other metabolic
    \n\nchanges create a pleasurable sensation in the user that \n\noften\u2014and
    paradoxically\u2014is experienced as a feeling of re- \n\nlaxation... This pleasurable
    sensation is one of the factors \n\nthat makes tobacco so addictive. Another
    is the fact that tol- \n\nerance to the effects of nicotine develops quite rapidly.

    nicotine. \n\nOnce the smoking habit has been acquired... it is difficult \n\nto
    break. Some authorities have stated that addiction to to- \n\nbacco may be harder
    to overcome than addiction to heroin \n\nor cocaine. This is because smoking
    creates both physical \n\nand psychological dependency. It may be easier to over-
    \n\ncome the physical addiction than the psychological de- \n\npendency. Acute
    physical withdrawal... while unpleasant... \n\nlasts for a limited period of
    time... usually no more than sev- \n\neral weeks. Long-term cravings are more
    likely a matter of \n\nSmoking Dependency \n\npsychological dependency... and
    require an ongoing effort to \n\nmaster. By the time an individual has become
    addicted to \n\nnicotine... the act of smoking itself has become a source of
    \n\npleasure... and it may be so intertwined in your mind with \n\nother activities\u2014having
    your morning coffee... reading the \n\nnewspaper... working... socializing...
    whatever\u2014that you find \n\nyourself unable to imagine engaging in these
    activities \n\nwithout a cigarette in hand. In addition... smoking provides \n\na
    convenient excuse for taking a momentary break... espe- \n\nc.ially during times
    of stress... and mav help to smooth over \n\nawkward moments. Manv smokers also
    are afraid of what \n\nmight happen if they stopped; they fear withdrawal symp-
    \n\ntoms... weight gain... or a decreased ability to concentrate. All \n\nof
    these factors combine to make quitting difficult. \n\nEven though it can be difficult
    to stop smoking... many \n\npeople do it every day. There is certainly no shortage
    of rea- \n\nsons to quit. Cigarettes are a factor in approximately 17 per: \n\ncent
    of all deaths in the United States annually\u2014that's \n\nto 400...000 people
    a year. This is more than the num- \n\nber of deaths from alcohol... illegal
    drugs... traffic accidents... \n\nsuicide... and homicide combined. Tobacco smoking
    causes \n\nan estimated 33 percent of all cancer deaths... 25 percent of \n\nfatal
    heart attacks... and 85 percent of deaths from chronic \n\nobstructive pulmonary
    disease... It accounts for at least 85 \n\npercent of lung cancer cases. Many
    other health problems \n\nhave been linked to smoking as well... including angina...
    ar- \n\nteriosclerosis... cataracts... chronic bronchitis... circulatory ail-
    \n\nments... colorectal cancer... diarrhea... emphysema... heartburn... \n\nhigh
    blood pressure... impotence... peptic ulcers... respiratory \n\nailments... urinary
    incontinence... and cancers of the mouth \n\nand throat... especially among cigarette
    smokers who also \n\nconsume alcohol and/or use mouthwash containing alco- \n\nhol.
    Smoking increases the risk of catching colds and \n\nlengthens recovery time.
    Tobacco smoke paralyzes the cilia \n\n(hairlike protrusions lining the nose and
    throat)... reducing \n\ntheir capacity to clear the passages by moving mucu s\u2014and
    \n\nthe cold viruses trapped within it\u2014to the outside. \n\nNicotine has
    long been known to be a deadly toxin. A \n\nsingle pinhead-sized drop of liquid
    nicotine... introduced di- \n\nrectly into the bloodstream... would be fatal.
    At the doses \n\nnormally ingested bv smokers... nicotine makes the heart \n\npump
    faster and work harder... increasing the likelihood of \n\nheart disease. It
    also constricts the peripheral blood vessels... \n\ncontributing to circulatory
    disorders such as Raynaud's \n\nphenomenon and hardening of the arteries. And
    nicotine is \n\nnot the only ingredient in cigarettes that poses a danger to
    \n\nhealth. In all... over chemical substances have been \n\nidentified as constituents
    of cigarette smoke... and at least 43 \n\nof these substances are known to cause
    cancer in humans... \n\nCigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide... benzene...
    cva- \n\nnide... ammonia... nitrosamines... vinyl chloride... radioactive \n\nparticles...
    and other known irritants and carcinogens. Car- \n\nbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin...
    interfering with the \n\ntransport of oxygen throughout the body. Carbon monox-
    \n\nide also promotes the development of cholesterol deposits \n\non artery walls.
    These two factors increase the risk of heart \n\n635 \n\n\nSmoking Dependency
    \n\nattack and stroke- Hydrogen cyanide causes bronchitis by \n\ninflaming the
    lining of the bronchi. Over the long term... \n\nsmoking dramatically reduces
    flow of blood to the brain. \n\nMen who have smoked for years are more likely
    to have ab- \n\nnormally low penile blood pressure... which contributes to \n\nimpotence.
    This is probably because smoking damages the \n\nblood vessels... including the
    tiny blood vessels that supply \n\nthe penis. ht also contributes to sterility;
    the sperm of men \n\nwho smoke have less ability than that of nonsmokers to \n\npenetrate...
    and thus to fertilize... an egg- \n\nFemale cigarette smokers tend to experience
    menopause \n\nearlier... face a greater risk of osteoporosis after menopause...
    \n\nand have a much higher risk of developing cervical or uter- \n\nine cancer.
    They also appear less fertile and have more dif- \n\nficu(ties during pregnancy.
    Smokers tend to have more \n\nmiscarriages... stillbirths... and premature deliveries.
    Their \n\nbabies often are smaller and have more health problems \n\nthan babies
    of nonsmokers. Infants whose mothers smoke \n\nboth during pregnancy and after
    childbirth appear to be \n\nthree times as Likely to die of sudden infant death
    syndrome \n\n(SIDS) as infants of nonsmokers. \n\nChildren whose fathers smoke
    also face an increase in \n\nhealth problems. Children of male smokers have been
    \n\nshown to be at a higher than norrnal risk of developing \n\nbrain cancer
    and leukemia. \n\nSmoking has a detrimental effect on nutTition. Smokers \n\nbreak
    down vitamin C about twice as fast as nonsmokers. \n\nThis can deprive the body
    of adequate amounts of one of \n\nthe most powerful and versatile antioxidants
    at our dis- \n\nposal. Other an\xE5oxidant vitamins are depleted as well. Cig-
    \n\narette smoke contains high concentrations of nitrogen \n\ndioxide ozone...
    a compound that oxidizes the antioxidant \n\nvitamins and is also known to do
    damage to DNA. The ac- \n\ncelerated antioxidant usage... in combination with
    the DNA \n\ndamage... speeds the aging process. \n\nFinally... smoking is increasingly
    a social problem. More \n\nand more nonsmokers are becoming concerned about the
    \n\neffects of \"\"secondhand\"\" smoke on their own health... and \n\njustifiably
    so. There is a growing body of evidence that sec- \n\nondhand smoke may be even
    more dangerous than the \n\nsmoke the smoker breathes. Smoking is now prohibited
    in \n\nmany workplaces and public buildings. \n\nThe dangers of smoking are well
    known today... yet peo- \n\nple continue to smoke. Why? Some people started smoking
    \n\nbefore the hazards were widely knovvrn; others start in ado- \n\nlescence...
    when people generally feel invulnerable and are \n\nmore likely to engage in
    risk-taking behavior\u2014especially if \n\nit seems \"\"adult...\"\" helps them
    fit in with a particular social \n\ngroup... and/or provokes their parents. However...
    surveys \n\nconsistently show that no matter when or why they started... \n\nmost
    current smokers do not smoke because they want to \n\n(well over 50 percent say
    they wish they had never started)... \n\nbut because they are addicted. \n\nThe
    good news is that this addiction can be overcome... \n\nand that health benefits
    begin almost immediately. In just \n\ntwenty-four hours after your last cigarette...
    your blood pres- \n\n636 \n\nTHE DISORDERS Part Two \n\nsure and pulse rate should

    containing several herbs... including echinacea... \n\nlicorice... and ginger.
    \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\nBe sure to cook all your food until it is tender. Poaching
    \n\nand steaming are good methods of cooking to retain mois- \n\nture. \n\nCut
    your food into very small pieces\u2014or... if necessary... \n\ngrind or pur\xE9e
    it. This will cause less irritation to the throat. \n\nBe sure to chew your food
    well before swallowing. \n\nUse frozen popsicles... ice cream... yogurt... and
    sherbet to \n\nsoothe a sore throat. \n\nAvoid eating foods that are spicy...
    hot... salty or acidic. \n\nThese can be irritating to the throat. \n\nIf you
    are having an especially difficult time swallow- \n\ning and are not able to
    get the proper intake of nutrients... \n\ndrinking an instant breakfast drink.
    \n\nIf your physidan prescribes antibiotics for a bacterial \n\nthroat infection...
    eat yogurt and take an acidophilus sup- \n\nplement to replace the \"\"friendly\"\"
    bacteria. Do not take \n\nthe acidophilus at the same time of day as the antibiotic...
    \n\nhowever. \n\nLiquid vitamin C... made by dissolving vitamin C pow- \n\nder
    in water or juice... is good to sip. Allow it to drip down \n\nthe throat slowly.
    \n\nGargle alternately with chlorophyll liquid and sea salt \n\n(1/2 teaspoon
    in a glass of warm water) every few hours. \n\nDrink plenty of liquids. Fresh
    juices are best. \n\nSip tea made from chamomile or sage... or some chicken \n\nor
    vegetable broth to keep your throat lubricated. \n\n[2 Use a mixture of raw honey
    and lemon juice to coat and \n\nsoothe the throat \n\n[3 Try using homeopathic
    remedies to relieve symptoms. \n\nAconite... Belladonna... Ferrum phosphoricum...
    and Gelsemium are \n\nsome of the homeopathic remedies that have been used to
    \n\ntreat sore throat. \n\nSee FASTING in Part Three... and follow the program.
    \n\nIf you smoke... stop. Smoking is a major cause of sore \n\nthroats. (See
    SMOKING DEPENDENCY in Part Two.) \n\nSnoring can make a sore throat much l\u2022nore
    painful. If \n\nyou snore... try sleeping on your side or using adhesive \n\nstrips
    that hold the nostrils open. These can be found in \n\ndrugstores and many supermarkets.
    \n\nSpider Bite \n\nSeek a physician's care if your sore throat is accompa- \n\nnied
    by any of the following: \n\nHigh or persistent fever. A fever that is higher
    than 102QF \n\nshould be evaluated by a physician. \n\n\u2022 Rash. This can
    be a sign of strep throat or other poten- \n\ntially serious conditions. \n\n\u2022
    Severe headache and stiff neck This can be a symptom \n\n- of meningitis. \n\n\u2022
    Prolonged hoarseness. This may indicate an underlying \n\nmedical problem such
    as throat cancer or oral cancer. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS \n\nA constant tickle or
    chronic irritating cough can be an \n\nindication of food allergies. (See ALLERGIES
    in Part Two.) \n\nIf sore throat recurs or lasts for longer than two weeks...
    \n\nyou may have an underlying illness such as mononu- \n\ncleosis. \n\nMany
    sore throats and infections are contracted from \n\nbacteria on toothbrushes.
    Toothbrushes should be replaced \n\nonce monthly and after any type of infectious
    illness. Be- \n\ntween uses... store your toothbrush in hydrogen peroxide or
    \n\ngrapefruit seed extract to kill germs (if you use hydrogen \n\nperoxide...
    rinse the toothbrush well before brushing). \n\n[2 Breathing in dry air can sometimes
    worsen the sore- \n\nness... A humidifier or vaporizer can help by adding more
    \n\nmoisture to the air. \n\n[2 see also COB*LMON COLD; MONONUCLEOSIS; SINUSITIS;

    can be poisonous and painful... How- \n\never... most spiders are not big enough
    to cause serious \n\nharm. Infants... older adults... and people of any age who

    \n\nstiffness... sweating... vomi\xE5ng... and weakness. \n\nTwo types of spider\u2014the
    black widow and the brown \n\nrecluse\u2014are more poisonous than most and can
    cause a se- \n\nrious reaction. The bite of the black widow spider can cause
    \n\nabdon\xFCnal pain similar to that of appendici\xFCs... spastic mus- \n\ncle
    contractions... and localized tissue death... In about 4 per- \n\ncent of cases...
    black widow bites lead to anaphylactic shock \n\nand death. This spider has a

    \n\", x, \"\nSore throats are one of the most common health complaints. \n\nThey
    are characterized by a raw... burning... and/or scratchy \n\nfeeling at the back
    of the throat. Most sore throats are \n\ncaused by viral infections such as the
    common cold. Bacte- \n\nrial infection... especially Streptococcus infection...
    can also be \n\nresponsible. In addition... a sore throat can be caused by any-
    \n\nthing that irritates the sensitive mucous membranes at the \n\nback of the
    throat and mouth. Some irritants include med- \n\nications... surgery... radiation
    therapy... dust... smoke... fumes... ex- \n\ntremely hot foods or drinks... tooth
    or gum infections... dental \n\nwork... and abrasions. Chronic coughing and excessive
    loud \n\ntalking also irritate the throat. \n\nAn acute sore throat usually runs
    its course within a few \n\ndays to a few weeks. Sore throats are seldom serious...
    but \n\nquite often are the first symptom of another disorder. Sore \n\nthroats
    can signal a cold... flu... mononucleosis... Epstein-Barr \n\nvirus... herpes

    \n\nto ragweed. \n\nThyme reduces fever... headaches... and mucus. It is good
    \n\nfor chronic respiratory problems and sore throat. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS \n\nUse
    a warm saltwater gargle. Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon of \n\nsalt in 1 cup of warm water
    and gargle with the mixture \n\nthree times a day to help reduce swelling...
    relieve pain... and \n\nremove mucus. \n\nApply hot or cold compresses... whichever
    one provides \n\nmore relief... to the throat area... \n\nDo not smoke... and
    avoid secondhand smoke. Tobacco \n\nsmoke irritates the throat. \n\nAdd humidity
    to the air at home with a humidifier... a \n\npan of water placed on a radiator...
    or boiling a pot of water \n\non the stove. Moistening steam stimulates the blood
    flow to \n\nthe mucous membranes... promoting healing. \n\nFor relief of tonsillitis
    pain... inhale essential oils of berg- \n\namot... lavender... tea tree... thyme...
    benzoin... and lemon. \n\nIf you have a sore throat that does not improve within
    \n\ntwo weeks... consult your health care provider to determine \n\nwhat type
    of sore throat you have. \n\nIf your physician prescribes antibiotics for bacterial
    \n\ntonsillitis... eat yogurt and take an acidophilus supplement \n\nto replace
    the \"\"friendly\"\" bacteria. Do not take the acido- \n\nphilus at the same
    time as the antibiotic... however. \n\nRest and drink plenty of fluids. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS
    \n\nA cleansing juice fast for thtee days with vegetable \n\nbroth can be helpful.

    \n\nIf an abscess develops... surgical drainage may be re- \n\nquired. \n\nIf
    tonsillitis becomes recurrent or chronic... tonsillectomy \n\n(temoval of the

    \n\nmay have been exposed to it... see your health care provider. \n\nPrompt...
    proper treatment is essentiaL \n\nFollow the prescribed treatment regimen exactly.
    If any \n\nmedications cause side effects... contact your physician. Do \n\nnot
    discontinue taking the medications on your own. \n\nTo promote healing... eat
    a diet consisting of at least 50 \n\npercent raw vegetables and fruits. Also
    eat alfalfa sprouts... \n\nfish... fowl... pomegranates... raw cheeses... raw
    seeds and nuts... \n\nwhole grains... and garlic. \n\nDrink fresh pineapple and
    carrot juice and a \"\"green \n\ndrink\"\" daily Drink fresh raw potato juice;
    potato juice con- \n\ntains compounds called protease inhibitors... which block
    \n\ncarcinogens and prevent cell mutation. (See JUICING in Part \n\nThree.) \n\nMake
    pur\xE9e of steamed asparagus in a blender- Re- \n\nfrigerate and take 4 tablespoons
    twice a day with meals. \n\nAsparagus stimulates immune function and is anticarcin-
    \n\nogenic. \n\nMake kefir... buttermilk... and fresh sugar-free yogurt a \n\npart
    of your daily diet. Also take an acidophilus supple- \n\nment for as long as
    you are taking antibiotics... to relieve \n\nstress on the gastrointestinal tract
    and enhance nutrient \n\nabsorption. Do not take the acidophilus at the same
    time \n\nas the antibiotic... but do make sure you take it. \n\nDo not smoke
    or consume alcohol or use recreational \n\ndrugs. All of these affect the ability
    of the immune system \n\nto fight infection. Smoking is even more dangerous than
    \n\nusual in the presence of a lung infection- \n\nAvoid stress. Rest... sunshine...
    and fresh air are most im- \n\nportant. A dry climate is recommended. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS
    \n\nQ People infected with TB should not use cortisone \n\npreparations. Cortisone
    suppresses immune function and \n\nmakes the infection more difficult to heat.
    \n\nQ Vaccines and drugs cannot control TB if poor lifestyle \n\npractices are
    followed. Cleanliness and proper nutrition are \n\nvital in combating this disease.
    \n\n\nTumor \n\nExperts estimate that up to 90 percent of the population \n\nmay
    have encountered the tubercle bacillus sometime in \n\ntheir lives... but in
    the majority of cases... the immune system \n\nsuccessfully keeps a full-blown
    infection from developing. \n\nPeople who do not defeat it outright often carry
    the germ \n\nin a dormant state... sometimes for decades... before immu- \n\nnity
    weakens and the bacteria begin replicating and infect \n\nthe host. \n\nThe Air
    Supply personal air purifier from Wein Prod- \n\nucts is a small unit worn around
    the neck. It sets up an in- \n\nvisible pure air shield against microorganisms
    (such as \n\nviruses... bacteria... and mold) and microparticles (including \n\ndust...
    pollen... and pollutants) in the air. It also eliminates va- \n\npors... smells...
    and harmful volatile compounds in the air... The \n\nLiving Air XL-15 unit from
    Alpine Industries is an ionizing \n\nunit good for purifying the air in the home
    or workplace. \n\nThe tubercle bacillus has an incredible capacity for \n\nreproduction.
    A single organism is capable of producing \n\nbillions of descendants within
    one month. \n\nThe American Lung Association estimates that tuber- \n\nculosis
    affects approximately 6.8 of every 100...000 persons \n\nin the United States.
    The World Health Organization has \n\nsingled out TB as a \"\"global health emergency.\"\"
    \n\nPeople with AIDS are more likely than most to have tu- \n\nberculosis at
    some point during their illness \n\nto The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG)...
    which \n\nconsists of a weakened form of tubercle bacilli... can be used \n\nfor
    vaccination against tuberculosis. Many medical author- \n\nities believe BCG
    is an effective preventive measure against \n\nT B... while others have serious
    doubts about its safety. A TB \n\nskin test may indicate if you are carrying
    TB bacteria even \n\nbefore you have symptoms of the disease. \n\nThe World Health
    Organization has recommended a \n\nglobal strategy\u2014directly observed treatment
    short course... \n\nor DOTS\u2014as a method of conquering TB. The basis of this
    \n\nprogram is to both treat and then monitor the TB infected \n\nsubjects very
    closely... making sure they complete their \n\ncourse of antibiotics. Cure rates
    in this type of program \n\nhave reached as high as 95 percent... even in the
    poorest of \n\nconditions where TB used to thrive. \n\n\", x, \"\nTuberculosis
    (T B) is a very old and highly contagious dis- \n\nease caused by the bacteria
    Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is \n\nprimarily a disease of the lungs... but
    it can affect any body \n\norgan... including the bones... kidneys... intestines...
    spleen... and \n\nliver. One of the most lethal among infectious diseases...
    TB \n\nis found throughout the world. It is especially devastating \n\nin places
    such as Asia and Africa... where HIV and AIDS are \n\nwidespread and have compromised
    the immune systems of \n\nso many people that the tuberculosis bacteria often
    meet \n\nwith little or no resistance. It is estimated that by the year \n\n2020...
    there will be 200 million new cases of this disease... and \n\n70 million people
    worldwide will die from it \n\nTB is usually spread by infected airborne droplets
    that \n\nare coughed up by individuals with the active disease and \n\nthen inhaled
    by susceptible persons. Once inhaled... the bac- \n\nteria normally lodge in
    the lungs. The body may success- \n\nfully battle the infection at this point.
    If the immune system \n\nis not functioning optimally... however... or if another
    on- \n\nslaught of the bacteria reaches the lungs... chances are the \n\nbacteria
    will multiply and proceed to liquefy and destroy \n\nlung tissue- Overcrowded...
    poorly ventilated housing and \n\noverpopulated prisons are fertile breeding
    grounds for the \n\nspread of T B. Tuberculosis may also be contracted from \n\ncontaminated
    food or from milk that has not been pasteur- \n\nized... In such cases... the
    primary focus of the infection usu- \n\nally is in the digestive tract. This
    type of tuberculosis is \n\nmore common in developing countries. It is rare in
    the \n\nWestern world. \n\nSymptoms of may be slow in developing and initially
    \n\nresemble those of influenza\u2014general malaise... coughing... \n\nloss
    of appetite... night sweats... chest pain... and low\u2022grade \n\nfever...
    At first... the cough may be nonproductive... but as the \n\ndisease progresses...
    increasing amounts of sputum are pro- \n\nduced. As the condition worsens...
    fever... night sweats... \n\nchronic fatigue... weight loss... chest pain...
    and shortness of \n\nbreath may occur... and the sputum may become bloody. In
    \n\nadvanced cases... TB of the larynx can occur... making it im- \n\npossible
    to speak above a whisper. \n\nAntibiotic regimens that could successfully combat
    the \n\ndisease have been developed... and living standards have \n\nrisen so
    that the poor nutrition and inadequate hygienic \n\nstandards that had once helped
    TB to spread and flourish \n\nare less prevalent in the United States. In spite
    of the fact \n\nthat multi-drug-resistant stTains of TB exist (if a strain of
    TB \n\nis resistant to both of the drugs most often widely pre- \n\nscribed for
    T B... it is considered multi-drug-resistant)... rates \n\nof TB have declined
    in the United States since 1993. Just \n\nover 18...000 cases of the disease
    were reported in 1998. \n\nBut the global epidemic of tuberculosis... together

    fast for three days on raw pineapple. \n\n(See FASTING in Part Three.) The bromclain
    in pineapple de- \n\nstroys tapeworms. \n\nDrink plenty of papaya juice. \n\nFor
    pinworms... eat bitter melon... a cucumber-shaped \n\nvegetable found in Asian
    markets. This is effective against \n\npinworms and is a good immune system strengthener-
    Eat \n\none or two melons a day for seven to ten days. Do this again \n\nafter
    two months to ensure that the infestation has not re- \n\nturned. \n\nNever eat
    meat... fish... or poultry that is not fully cooked \n\nor that has been left
    out at room ternperature for too long. \n\n(See FOODBORNE/WATERBORNE DISEASE
    in Part Two.) \n\nTake a warm bath using 1/2 cup of Epsom salts per gal- \n\nIon
    of water. Before getting into the water... apply zinc oxide \n\nto the opening
    of the anus. Repeat for three days in a row. \n\nHave pet cats and dogs checked
    and... if appropriate... \n\ntreated for parasites when you first get them...
    and in the \n\nspring and fall of each year thereafter. \n\nAlways wear shoes
    in soiled areas. \n\nMaintain meticulous personal hygiene. Avoid scratch- \n\ning
    the anal area... and wash your hands frequently... prefer- \n\nably with antibacterial
    soap... scrubbing well under the \n\nfingernails. If children are affected...
    teach them proper hy- \n\ngiene as v...rell. \n\nWash all utensils and surfaces
    that come in contact with \n\nraw meat... pork... or fish with antibacterial
    soap. \n\nWash underwear... bed linens... and towels after each use \n\nin very
    hot water with chlorine bleach added... if possible. \n\nChange linens and towels
    daily. \n\nFor a severe infestation... use high colonics (also known \n\nas colonic
    irrigation). This procedure is usually performed \n\nin a professional office.
    If this treatment is not available... fol- \n\nlow the procedure for colon cleansing
    described in this \n\nbook. (See COLON CLEANSING and ENEMAS... both in Part \n\nThree.)
    A product called 10-Day Colon Cleanse from Aero- \n\nbic Life Industries is also
    recommended. \n\nCONSIDERATIONS \n\nWorm infestations can be persistent and stubborn.
    It \n\nmay be necessary to treat all members of the household to \n\nfinally
    eradicate the parasites. All family members should \n\nbe examined for possible
    infection. In addition... it is a good \n\nidea to compile a list of people who
    have been in close con- \n\ntact with the affected individual and advise them
    to seek \n\nthe evaluation and advice of a health care provider. \n\n688 \n\nTHE
    DISORDERS Part Two \n\nThe following are the routes through which different \n\ntypes
    of worms can enter the bodv: \n\nAscarids: Through the soil; or in contaminated
    raw or \n\nundercooked food... \n\nHookworms and threadworms: Through the feet
    or \n\ndrinking water. \n\n\u2022 Pinworms: Eggs can be transferred by touch
    from an in- \n\nfected individual that has eggs on the fingers from scratch-
    \n\ning the affected area. \n\n\u2022 Tapeworms: In raw or undercooked beef...
    fish... or pork... \n\nor through inadvertently swallowing infested fleas or
    lice \n\nthat live on pets. \n\nDoctors treat most types of worms with prescription
    \n\nmedications such as mebendazole (Vermox) or thiabenda- \n\nzole (Mintezol)...
    or with pyrantel pamoate (Antiminth)... \n\nwhich is available over the counter.
    Creams or ointments \n\nmay be prescribed to relieve anal itching and irritation.
    \n\n[2 Some sushi has been found to be contaminated with a \n\nwormlike parasite
    called anisakis... which can cause illness \n\nsimilar to Crohn's disease if
    ingested... This parasite is a \n\ntightly coiled... clear wormr about one-half
    to three-quarters \n\ninch in length. It commonly embeds itself in herring and
    \n\nother fish. Fortunately... an experienced sushi chef can spot \n\nthis parasite
    easily... so its presence in sushi is relatively rare. \n\nThe risk of parasitic
    infection is increased by travel to \n\nplaces mith inadequate public sanitation...
    personal hygiene \n\nlevels... and/or food handling practices. \n\nBecause of
    the generalized nutritional deficiency asso- \n\nciated with this disorder...
    good nutrition is vital. Foods high \n\nin protein and iron are particularly
    important. \n\", x, \"Worms are parasites that live in the gastrointestinal tract.
    \n\nThe most common types of worms are roundworms (in- \n\neluding ascarids...
    hookworms... pinworms... and threadworms) \n\nand tapeworms. Roundworms are contagious
    intestinal \n\nparasites that are shaped like earthworms but smaller in \n\nsize...
    They can easily be seen with the naked eye. Pinworms \n\nare white... threadlike
    worms about one-third inch long. \n\nTapeworms vary in length from an inch up
    to thirty feet \n\nand can survive for up to twenty-five years in the body. In
    \n\nthe United States... pinworm infestation in young children is \n\nby far
    the most prevalent parasitic worm problem. \n\nDepending on the type of worm
    involved and the sever- \n\nity of the infestation... there may be a variety
    of symptoms. \n\nIn some cases... there may be no perceptible symptoms at all.
    \n\nIn some cases... worms may be seen in the stool- \n\nPinworms can cause severe
    anal itching (especially at \n\nnight... as the worms tend to migrate outside
    the anus to lay \n\ntheir eggs)... insomnia... and restlessness. Hookworms can
    \n\ncause itching on the soles of the feet... and in some cases... \n\nbloody
    sputum... fever... rash... and loss of appetite. Thread- \n\nworms can cause
    coughing or bronchitis... abdominal pain... \n\ndiarrhea... and gas... preceded
    by tiny red abrasions that \n\nsometimes itch. Small tapeworms can cause weight
    and ap- \n\npetite loss... abdominal pain... vomiting... and diarrhea... Large
    \n\ntapeworms can cause similar symptoms... but usually with- \n\nout weight
    loss. Ascariasis... caused bv ascarids... is charac- \n\nterized bv bloating...
    stomach pain... vomiting... and difficulty \n\nbreathing. Trichinosis is a disease
    caused by a microscopic \n\nroundworm that... if left untreated... can lead to
    muscle dam- \n\nage and cardiac or neurologic complications. \n\nPart Two THE
    DISORDERS \n\nWorm infestations can range from mild to severe... even \n\nlife
    threatening... particularly in children. They result in poor \n\nabsorption of
    essential nutrients... and in some cases... loss of \n\nblood from the gastrointestinal
    tract. They can therefore \n\nlead to such deficiency-related disorders as anemia
    and \n\ngrowth problems. Malabsorption resulHng from parasitic \n\ninfection
    makes one susceptible to many diseases because \n\nit results in diminished immune
    function. \n\nWorms can be contracted through a variety of mecha- \n\nnisms...
    including improper disposal of human or animal \n\nwaste... walking barefoot
    on contaminated soil... and inges- \n\ntion of eggs or larvae from uncooked or
    partially cooked \n\nmeat. In some cases... eggs may become airborne and be \n\ninhaled.
    \n\nParasites are more common than most people suppose... \n\nand they can be
    behind many illnesses... including colon \n\ndisorders. They are more common
    in children than in \n\nadults. They are also common in people with AIDS... chronic
    \n\nfatigue syndrome... candidiasis... and many other disorders. \n\nUnfortunately...
    physicians often do not check for worm \n\ninfestation. \n\nThe dosages recommended
    here are for adults. For a \n\nchild between the ages of twelve and seventeen...
    reduce the \n\ndose to threequarters of the recommended amount. For a \n\nchild
    between six and twelve... use one-half of the recom- \n\nmended dose... and for
    a child under the age of six... use one- \n\nquarter of the recommended amount.
