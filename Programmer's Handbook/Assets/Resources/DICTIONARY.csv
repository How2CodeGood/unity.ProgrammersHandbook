 TO THE REVISED EDITION,"'IT  took the world by  storm'  said  The  Times,  in its obituary notice of H.  W.  Fowler, about  The  King's  English,  published by him and his younger  brother Frank in  1906.  That  description might have been more fitly applied to the reception of  A Dictionary of Modern English  Usage which followed twenty years later, planned by the two brothers but executed by Henry alone. This was indeed an epoch-making book in the strict sense of  that  overworked phrase. It made the name of Fowler a  household word in all English-speaking countries. Its influence ex- tended  even  to the battlefield. 'Why must you write  intensive  here  ?' asked the  Prime  Minister in a minute to the Director of Military Intelligence about plans for the invasion of Normandy.  'Intense  is the right word. You should read Fowler's  Modern English  Usage  on the use of the two words.' 1  Though never revised, the book has  kept  its place against all rivals,  and shown little  sign  of suffering from  that  reaction which commonly awaits those whose work achieves exceptional popularity in their lifetime. What  is the secret of its  success?  It is not  that  all Fowler's opinions are  unchallengeable. Many have been challenged. It is not  that  he is always  easy  reading. At his best he is incomparable. But he never forgot what he  calls  'that  pestilent fellow the critical reader' who is 'not satisfied  with  catching the general drift and obvious intention of a sentence' but insists  that  'the words used must . . . actually yield on scrutiny the desired sense'. 2  There are some  passages  that  only yield it after what the reader may think an excessive amount of  scrutiny— passages  demanding hardly  less  concentration than one of the more obscure sections of a Finance Act, and for the same reason : the deter- mination of the writer to make sure  that,  when the reader eventually gropes  his way to a meaning, it shall be, beyond all possible  doubt,  the meaning  intended by the writer. Nor does the secret lie in the conveni- ence of the book as a work of reference; it hardly deserves its title of 'dictionary',  since much of it consists of short  essays  on various subjects, some  with  fancy titles  that  give  no clue at all to their subject.

 EDITION,"tight and high. If writers today no longer feel the burden of fetters such as these they have  largely  the Fowlers to thank. On the other hand, Fowler has been  criticized—notably  by his famous contemporary  Jespersen—for  being in some respects too strict and old- fashioned.  He was a  'prescriptive'  grammarian, and prescriptive gram- mar is not now in favour outside the schoolroom. Jespersen, the 'grammatical  historian', held  that  'of greater value than this prescriptive grammar is a purely  descriptive  grammar which, instead of acting as a guide  to  what  should be  said  or  written,  aims at finding out  what  is actually  said  or  written  by those who use the  language' 1  and recording it objectively like a naturalist observing the facts of nature. 2  Fowler, the 'instinctive grammatical moralizer' (as Jespersen called him and he welcomed the description), held  that  the proper purpose of a gram- marian was 'to tell the people not  what  they do and how they came to do it, but  what  they ought to do for the future'. 3  His respect for  what  he regarded  as the  true  principles of grammar was as great as was his con- tempt  for its fetishes and superstitions. He has been criticized for rely- ing  too much on Latin grammar for those principles. In  part  he admitted the charge.  'Whether  or not it is regrettable', he  said,  'that  we  English have for centuries been taught  what  little grammar we know on Latin traditions, have we not now to recognize  that  the iron has entered into our  souls,  that  our grammatical conscience has by this  time  a Latin element inextricably compounded in it, if not predominant?' 4  At the same  time  he had nothing but  contempt  for those grammarians whom he described as  'fogging  the minds of  English  children  with  terms and notions  that  are essential to the understanding of Greek and Latin syntax but have no bearing on  English'. 5 The  truth  is  that  the prime mover of his moralizing was not so much grammatical grundyism as the instincts of a craftsman. 'Proper words in proper places',  said  Swift, 'make the  true  definition of a style.' Fowler thought so  too;  and, being a perfectionist, could not be satisfied  with anything  that  seemed to him to  fall  below the highest standard either in the choice of precise words or in their careful and orderly arrangement. He knew, he  said,  that  'what  grammarians say should be has perhaps  less influence on  what  shall be than even the more modest of  them  realize; usage  evolves itself little disturbed by their likes and dislikes'. 'And yet', he added, 'the  temptation  to show how  better  use might have been made 1  Essentials  of  English  Grammar,  p.  19. 2  Enc.  Brit.,  s.v.

 i.,"Normal use of -able  as living suffix. 2. Choice be- tween  -able  and  -ible  (or  -uble).  3. Negative forms of adjectives in  -ble.  4. -ble  words of exceptional form or sense. 1.  Normal use of -able as living suf- fix. The suffix  -able  is a living one, and may be appended to any transitive verb to make an adjective  with  the sense able,  or  liable,  or  allowed,  or  worthy,  or requiring,  or  bound, to  be   ed.  If the verb ends in  mute  -e, this is retained after soft c or g  (pronounceable,  manage- able)  and generally  dropped  after  other consonants  (usable,  forgivable),  but on this see  MUTE  E.  Verbs ending in  -y  pre- ceded by a consonant change y into i (justifiable,  triable),  but not when pre- ceded by a vowel  (buyable, payable). Verbs  with  the Latin-derived ending -ate  that  have established adjectives drop the  -ate (demonstrable, abomin- able,  alienable, appreciable, calculable, expiable,  execrable,  etc.); and new ad- jectives from such verbs should be similarly  formed, but for possible ex- ceptions  See  -ATABLE. 2.  Choice  between  -able and -ible (or -uble).  The  -ible  form  is the natural one for words derived from Latin verbs ending  -ërë  or  -ire,  making adjectives in  -ibilis (dirigible, audible).  Otherwise -able  is the normal form and should be used unless  there  is a well-established -ible  form for the word, or it belongs to a  set  that  form their adjectives  that way;  for instance  perceivable  and  pre- scribable  should not be substituted for perceptible  and  prescriptible  and the established  convertible  should be de- cisive  for preferring  avertible  to  avert- able.  On the  other  hand adjectives in -able  may be formed even from those verbs whose established representa- tives end  -ible  when the established word has to some  extent  lost the verbal or  contracted,  a special sense. Thus a mistake may be called  uncorrectable, because  incorrigible  has become ethical in sense ;  solvable  may be preferred be- cause  soluble  has entered  into  an alliance with  dissolve;  a law  must  be described as  enforceable  to disclaim any relation- ship  between  that  passive-sense adjec- tive and the active-sense  forcible;  and destroyable  by dynamite  may seem  less pedantic than  destructible by  because destructible  tends to be purely adjec- tival.  The existence of a single estab- lished  -ible  word of a more or  less technical kind need not be allowed much  weight; e.g.  fusible  does not suffice  to condemn  confusable,  diffus- able,  and  refusable. 3.  Negative forms of adjectives in -ble. The adjectives in  -ble  being required  with  especial frequency in negative contexts, the question often arises  whether  the negative form of any  particular word should be made with  in-  or  un-.  The general principle is  (a)  that  negatives from  -ble  words other  than those in  -able  have  in-  (or ig-,  il-,  im-,  ir-);  the only exceptions are words already beginning  with  the prefix  im-  or  in-  (impressible,  intelli- gible),  and  (b)  negatives from words in -able  ordinarily have  un-,  but  there  are numerous exceptions  with  in-  (e.g.  im- probable,  inestimable).  These latter have a tendency, no  doubt  due to the greater familiarity of  un-,  to develop an  alternative negative form  with  that prefix (e.g.  approachable, surmount- able).  See IN- and  UN-. 4.  -ble words of exceptional form or sense. The normal formation and sense  of adjectives in  -able  have been explained in paragraph  1;  and adjec- tives in  -ible  have the same ordinary range  of sense. There are, however, large  numbers of words, and certain usages,  that  do not conform to this",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
able,"simple type,  and to  some  of  them (a  reliable  man,  perishable  articles, dutiable  goods,  feedable pasture,  an unplayable wicket,  an  actionable  of- fence,  payable  ore,  unwritable paper, and others) exception  is  often taken. The advocatus diaboli  who  opposes their recognition has  the  advantage  of an  instantly plausible case  that  can be put clearly  and  concisely:  we do not rely  a man, nor  perish articles,  nor play  a  wicket; therefore  we  have  no right  to  call  a  man unreliable,  and so with  the  rest.  An  answer  on the  same pattern  would  be  that  neither  do we dispense  a  man,  yet our  right  to  call him indispensable  is not  questioned. But  it is  better  to  go  on  broader lines, sacrificing  the  appearance  of  precision and cogency,  and  point  out  that  the termination  -ble  has too  wide  a  range in regard  both  to  formation  and to sense  and the  analogies offered  by the -ble  words  are too  various  and  debat- able  to  allow  of  the application  of cut- and-dried rules. The words and usages to which exception  is  taken should  be tested  not by the  original Latin prac- tice,  nor by the  subsequent French practice,  nor by the  English practice of  any particular past period, even  if any  of""  these were as precise as  is  some- times supposed,  but by  what  inquiry may reveal as  the  now  current  concep- tion  of how  words  in  -ble  are to be formed  and  what  they may mean.  In determining  that  conception we cannot help allowing  the  incriminated words themselves  to  count  for  something.  It may seem unfair  that  reliable  should itself  have  a  voice  in  deciding  its own fate ;  but it is no  more unfair than  that possession  should  be  nine points of the law.  The  existence  of the  still more modern  payable ore, playable wicket, unwritable  paper,  has  in the  same way its value  as  evidence;  the  witness-box is  open  to the  prisoner.  Apart,  how- ever, from this special proof  that  the current  conception  of  -ble  is  elastic,  it is  easy  to  show  that  at the  present stage of  its long history and varied develop- ment  it  could  not be  rigid.  In the  first place  the  original formation and mean- ing  of many common words containing",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
able,"it are obscured by  the  non-existence  in English  of  verbs  to  which they can  be neatly referred  {affable, amenable,  de- lectable,  feasible, plausible,  and  many others). Secondly,  there  are  many common words  in  which  the  sense  of -ble  either is (as sometimes  in  Latin),  or (which  is as  much  to the  point) seems to  be, not  passive  but  active  {agree- able,  capable,  comfortable,  hospitable, viable,  etc.). Thirdly,  -ble  is  often  ap- pended,  or  (which  is as  much  to the point) seems  to be  appended,  to  nouns instead  of to  verbs  {actionable,  com- panionable,  fashionable,  seasonable,  un- exceptionable,  etc.).  To  take  a  single example  in  detail,  no one but a com- petent  philologist  can  tell  whether reasonable  comes from  the  verb  or the noun  reason,  nor  whether  its  original sense  was  that  can  be  reasoned  out, or that  can reason,  or  that  can be reasoned with,  or  that  has reason,  or  that  listens to reason,  or  that  is  consistent  with reason.  The ordinary man knows only that  it  can now mean any  of  these, and justifiably  bases  on  these  and  similar facts  a  generous view  of the  termina- tion's capabilities  ;  credible  meaning  for him worthy  of  credence, why should not reliable  and  dependable  mean worthy of reliance  and  dependence?  Durable meaning likely  to  endure, why should not  payable  and  perishable  mean likely to  pay and  perish? In conclusion,  a  small selection  fol- lows  of  words  in  -ble,  other  than those already  mentioned,  that  illustrate  the looser  uses  of the  termination;  the paraphrases are offered merely  by  way of  accommodating each word  to  what is  taken  to be the  current  conception of  -ble:  accountable,  liable  to  account; answerable,  bound  to  answer;  appeal- able,  subject  to  appeal;  available,  that may avail;  bailable,  admitting  of  bail; chargeable,  involving charge  ;  clubbable, fit  for  a  club;  conformable,  that  con- forms;  conversable,  fit for  conversing; demurrable,  open  to  demur;  jeepable, capable  of  being traversed  by a  jeep; impressionable,  open  to  impressions; indispensable,  not  admitting  of dis- pensation;  knowledgeable,  having  or capable  of  knowledge;  laughable,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

absolute construction,"any  verb  or  the object  of  any  preposition but  is  attached  to a  participle  or an in- finitive,  e.g.  The  play  being  over,  we  went home.  / Let us  toss  for it,  loser  to  pay. 1.  The  insertion  of  a comma  between noun  and  participle  in the  absolute  use is  indisputably wrong.  It  arises from the writer's  or the  compositor's taking the noun, because  it  happens  to  stand first, for  the  subject  of the  main verb; and  it  puts  the  reader  to the  trouble  of readjusting his notion  of the  sentence's structure.  The  King having read  his speech  from  the  throne,  their Majesties retired  is the  right form;  but  news- paper writing  or  printing  is so  faulty on  the  point  that  it  would  be  likely  to appear  as  The  King, having read his  etc.  Thus :  By  mid-afternoon Lock, having  taken  seven  wickets  for  47,  it  was all  over,  j  The House  of  Commons,  hav- ing  once  decided against  the  capital penalties,  it  was  declared  impossible  that there  could  be  another execution  for forgery.  The  temptation  to put a comma  in  this position  is so  strong that  one may be  found even  in the rubric of a ceremonial service, presum- ably  prepared  with  scrupulous care: Bath King  of  Arms, having bowed first to  those Knights Grand Cross who have been  installed previously  and  then  to those  who are not to be  installed, they thereupon  sit in the  seats  assigned  to them. 2.  The  case  in  this construction  is the subjective; e.g.  There  being  no  clear evidence  against  him, and he  (not  him) denying  the  charge,  we could do nothing. There  is  little danger  of the  rule's being broken  except  where  a  pronoun stands  as a  complement. Though  no one would  write  me  being  the per- son  responsible,  the  form  the  person responsible  being  I  is  likely  to be shrunk from;  me  should  not be  used except  colloquially;  myself  is  usually possible,  but not  always.  The  formula whom failing  (=  or in  default  of him) should  be  either  who failing  or  failing whom;  the  justification  of  failing whom is  that  failing  has,  like  during  etc., passed  into  a  preposition,  and  whom failing  is a  confusion  between  the two right forms. 3.

The  following example  of one absolute construction  enclosed  in another  is a  pretty  puzzle  for  those who like such things:  To the new Greek  Note Bulgaria  replied  by  a  Note which  was returned  to the  Bulgarian Foreign  Minister,  Greece,  it  being  de- clared,  not  wishing  to  enter into  any bargaining.  It is  clear enough  that this will  not do; it  must  be  changed into (a)  it  being  declared  that  Greece  did not  wish,  or  (b)  Greece  not  wishing,  it was  declared,  to  .. .  ; but  why will  it  not do?  Because the absolute construction 'it  being declared' cannot, like  the 'it was declared'  of  (b),  be  parenthetic, but  must  be in adverbial relation  to the sentence. Knowing  that,  we  ask  what 'it'  is,  and  find  that  it can  only  be an anticipatory  it  (see  IT) equivalent  to 'that  Greece  did not  wish';  but the consequent expansion 'Greece,  that Greece  did not  wish being declared, not wishing' makes nonsense.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
absolute,"possessives. Under this term  are included  the  words  hers,  ours, theirs,  and  yours,  and  (except  in  their attributive-adjective use)  his, mine,  and thine.  The ordinary uses of these need not  be  set forth here though  it is per- haps  worth  remarking  that  the double possessive  of  such constructions  as a  friend  of  mine, that facetiousness of  his,  is  established idiom. See  OF  7. But  a  mistake  is  often made when  two or more possessives are  to be  referred to  a  single noun  that  follows  the  last of  them:  the  absolute word  in -s or  -ne is  wrongly used  in the  earlier place  or  places instead  of the  simple possessive.

There is  no  doubt  a  natural  temptation  to substitute  the  wrong word;  the  simple possessive  seems  to  pine  at  separation from  its  property.

abstractitis.,"The  effect  of  this disease,  now endemic  on  both  sides  of the Atlantic,  is to  make  the  patient write  such sentences  as  Participation by the men  in  the  control  of  the industry is non-existent  instead  of  The men have no  part  in the  control  of  the industry  ; Early  expectation  of a  vacancy  is  indi- cated  by the  firm  instead  of  The  firm say they expect  to  have  a  vacancy  soon; The availability  of  this material  is diminishing  instead  of  This  material  is getting  scarcer;  A  cessation  of  dredging has taken place  instead  of  Dredging  has stopped;  Was this the realization  of  an anticipated  liability?  instead  of  Did  you expect  you would have  to  do this?  And so  on,  with  an  abstract word always  in command  as the  subject  of the sen- tence. Persons  and  what  they  do, things  and  what  is  done  to  them,  are put  in the  background,  and we can only  peer  at  them  through  a  glass darkly.  It  may  no  doubt  be  said  that in these examples  the  meaning  is  clear enough;  but the  danger  is  that,  once the disease gets  a  hold,  it  sets  up a chain reaction.  A  writer  uses abstract words because his thoughts are cloudy; the habit  of  using  them  clouds  his thoughts still  further;  he  may  end by concealing  his meaning  not  only from his  readers  but  also from himself, and writing such sentences  as  The actuali- zation  of the  motivation  of  the  forces must  to a  great  extent  be a  matter  of personal  angularity.

Whereas the  micro-economic  neo- classical  theory of  distribution  was  based on  a postulate of rationality suited to their static analysis and institutional assumptions,  we are no  longer  justified in accepting this basis and are set the problem  of  discovering  the value  premises suited  to the expectational analysis and the institutional nature of modern busi- ness.  The neo-classical postulate of rationality and the  concept  of the entre- preneur  as the profit maximizing indivi- dual,  should, I  think,  be  replaced  by a sociological  analysis of the goals of the firm in relation to its nature  as  an organization  within the  socio-political system. 2.  Strangeness of samples has been shown  to lead to  relative  rejection  of products  in the comparative absence of clues  to a frame of  reference  within which  judgement may take place.

Addition of a functional {utilitarian)  basis  for judgement tends to reduce  relative importance of product physical  characteristics as a basis for judgement.  In the  absence  of any judge- mental frame of  reference  reduction in the number of  product  physical attri- butes  apparent to the judge appears to reduce  operation of  bases  for  rejection and  increase  homogeneity of judgement between  subjects; inter-sample discrimi- nation is also reduced.

"accessary, accessory.","The  words, though they have separate  histories,  are often confused. The following distinc- tion was favoured by the OED  (1888).

 action.,"The distinction between the two words is not always clear. The natural idea  that  act  should mean the thing done, and  action  the doing of it, is  not even historically quite  true,  since act  represents the Latin noun  actus (which is very close to  actio  in sense) as  well as the Latin participle  actum; but, even if not  true,  it has influence enough to prevent  act  from being com- monly used in the more abstract  senses. We can speak only of the  action,  not the  act,  of""  a machine, when we mean the way it acts; and  action  alone has the collective sense, as in  his action throughout  (i.e. his acts or actions as a whole)  was  correct.  There are  also other senses in which  there  is obviously no choice open. In contexts  that  do admit of  doubt,  it  may  be said generally that  action  tends to displace  act .

And  in  certain contexts  act  more than holds  its  ground:  (i)  in the  sense deed of  the  nature  of; it  would  be an act (never action)  of  folly,  cruelty, madness, kindness,  mercy,  etc.;  similarly  in the sense  deed characteristic  of; it was the act  (rarely  action)  of a  fool  (cf.  the actions  of a  fool  cannot  be  foreseen, where  the  sense  is not  characteristic deed,  but  simply  deed).  On the  other hand, when  for  of  folly  or  of  a  fool  etc. foolish  etc. is  substituted,  action  is at least  as  common  as  act — a  cruel,  kind, foolish,  noble,  base,  action  or  act .

Most English nouns in -a are from Latin  (or latinized Greek) nominative feminine singular nouns, which have in Latin the plural ending  -ae.  But not all;  e.g.  sofa  is from Arabic;  stanza  and vista  are from Italian;  subpoena  is not nominative;  drama  and  comma  are neuter;  data, strata,  stamina,  and prolegomena  are plural; and  with  all such words -ae is impossible. Of the majority,  again,  some retain the Latin -ae  in English either as the only or as an  alternative plural ending  {formulae or  -las, lacunae  or  -nas),  and some have always  -as (ideas, areas, villas).  The use of plurals in -ae therefore presents some difficulty to  non-latinists.  For most words  with  which -ae is possible or desirable the information is given in their dictionary places; for the principle of choice when  both  -ae and -as are  current  see LATIN PLURALS  I, 3- ae,  ce.  These ligatures (see  DIGRAPH), of  which the pronunciation is identical (ë),  are also in some founts of  type  so much  alike  that  compositors often use one for the  other  and unlearned readers have their difficulties  with spelling  increased. It seems desirable that  in the first place all words in common enough use to have begun to waver  between  the double  letter  and the simple e (as  pedagogy  now rarely pae-  or  pee-,  medieval  still often -aeval,  ecumenical  still usually  oe-  or ce-,  penology  now rarely  poe-  or  pee-) should be  written  with  the e alone, as phenomenon  now is; and secondly, in words  that  have not yet reached or can  for special reasons never reach the stage  in which the simple e is accept- able,  ae and oe should be preferred to ae  and  oe  {Caesar,  gynaecology,  paedi- atrics,  homoeopathy, diarrhoea, arch- aeology,  Boeotian, Oedipus;  the plurals and genitives of Latin first-declension nouns, as  sequelae, Heraclidae, aqua vitae).

"aggravate, aggravation.","For  many years  grammarians have been dinning into us  that  to  aggravate  has properly only  one  meaning—to  make (an evil) worse or more  serious—and  that  to use it in the sense of  annoy  or  exasperate  is a  vulgarism  that  should be left to the uneducated. But writers have shown no  less  persistence in refusing to be trammelled by this admonition. The OED, which  calls  the usage  'fam.', gives  examples  that  date back to  1611 and include quotations from Richard- son  and Thackeray. They have their distinguished  followers today.  But Archbishop  Tenison, though much out of  favour with the  Queen,  outlived her in the most  aggravating  manner  (G. M. Trevelyan).  /  He had  pronounced  and aggravating  views on what the United States  was  doing  for the  world  (Graham Greene). /  Then he  tried  to be less aggravating  (E. M. Forster). /  Syngman Rhee  has made it plain that he will go to  any  lengths  to aggravate the  commun- ists  into a renewal of the fighting  (  The New Statesman).  It is time to recognize that  usage has beaten the grammarians, as  it so often does, and  that  the con- demnation of this use of  aggravate  has become a  FETISH.  After all, the exten- sion  from aggravating a person's tem- per to aggravating the person himself is  slight and natural, and when we are told  that  Wackford Squeers pinched the boys in aggravating places we may reasonably  infer  that  his choice of places  aggravated  both  the pinches and the boys. ago.

Its use as  a transitive  verb  in the last sense, without  on,  was  said by the OED in 1888  to be applicable only to discrep- ant accounts and the like, but it is now much wider, especially in the p.p.  An agreed  statement was issued after the meeting.  /  The committee has  power  to agree  its own  procedure.  /  It  proved  im- possible  to  agree  a  price.  That  is un- exceptionable.

An allusion  is a  covert  or  indirect refer- ence,  in  which  the  application  of a generality  to the  person  or  thing  it is really  aimed  at, or the  identification  of something  that  the  speaker  or  writer appears  by his  words  to  have  in  mind but does  not  name,  is  left  for the hearer  or  reader  to  make;  it is  never an  outright  or  explicit mention.

ambiguity.,"The word as here used includes not only those ambiguities that  leave the reader genuinely puzzled which of two interpretations is right, but  also  those in which one of these, probably the more natural grammati- cally,  is clearly not what the writer meant. The fault of this kind of writing is  not so much obscurity as clumsiness. Like  that  described in the article  FALSE SCENT,  it misleads the reader only momentarily, if at all, but makes him think the writer a fool for not being able  to say what he means. As the purpose of this dictionary is to help writers to express themselves clearly and accurately, and the causes of ambiguity are innumerable, reference might perhaps here be made to its contents  passim .  But a few of the more frequent  of these causes deserve special  notice. 'Of  all the faults found in writing', wrote  Cobbctt  in  1818,  'the wrong placing  of words is one of the most common, and perhaps it leads to the greatest number of misconceptions.' Or, in the words of another old gram- marian, the golden rule of writing is  'that  the words or members most nearly  related should be placed in the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Few books since  published on grammar and usage have  omitted  to enliven an arid subject by  stock examples of this fault, such as  the well-worn one of the advertise- ment  of a piano for  sale  by a lady going abroad in an oak case  with  carved  legs. Nevertheless, carelessness of this kind is  still so common  that  it may be  worth while to  give  some  modern  examples by  way of warning.  No child shall be employed  on any weekday when the school  is not  open  for a  longer  period than  four  hours.  /  Please  state  from  what date the patient was sent to bed and totally incapacitated by your instruc- tions.

 GIMMICK,"as  readily  as our  fathers welcomed stunt, blurb,  and  rubberneck.  When  it is a  question  of  adopting  the  meaning given  in  America  to a  word  we use differently,  we  often  put up  more resistance,  but not  always: since  the war  we  have taken  to  using  assignment and  executive  in the  American senses  ; fix  for  mend  and  mad  for  angry  are com- mon.  Radio  is  displacing  wireless  and mail  encroaching  on  post  and the  Brit- ish  workman when  on  strike seems now  to  find  scab  a  more satisfactorily expressive word than  blackleg.  Gun has  been enlarged  to  include  a  revol- ver and an automatic, and  date  to  cover an  engagement,  and the  convenience of  such expressions  as  commuter  for one who travels daily to and from work and  reservation  for  advance  booking  is irresistible.  Luggage  has partly yielded to  baggage,  but  only  if  we are travelling by  sea or air.  Occasionally  we  have taken back words  that  went  over  with the Pilgrim Fathers  and  were  for- gotten  by  those they left behind;  the reappearance among  us of the now superfluous verb  loan  is  evidence  that we  do not  always show sound judge- ment  in  doing this.  But  some  of the long-standing  differences  in  vocabu- lary  seem  so  firmly rooted  as to be unshakable. There  is no  question  of merit  in it: we may  indeed maintain that  lift  is a  better  word than  elevator and  motor car  than  automobile,  but we cannot deny  that  fall  is  prettier  than autumn  and  sidewalk  more sensible than  pavement.

i,".  Both  are  LITERARY WORDS,  subject  to the  limitations  of their kind. 2.  As to the  alternative forms,  the OED states  that  'There  is a  tendency to use  amidst  more distributively,  e.g. of  things scattered about,  or a  thing moving,  in the  midst  of  others'. This may  have been  true  at  that  time  (1888) but  the  only distinction  that  can now be hazarded  is  that  amid  has dropped out  of  ordinary  use  even more than amidst,  and is  therefore  felt  to be inappropriate  in  many contexts that  can  still bear  amidst  or  in the midst  of.  When  we  find  amid  in a passage  of no  exalted  or  poetical kind (A  certain part  of  his  work  . . .  must be  done  amid  books),  our  feeling  is  that amidst  would have been  less  out of place,  though  among  would have been still  better.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
"among,",,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 amongst.,"There  is  certainly no broad distinction either  in  meaning or  in  use between  the  two.  The OED illustrates under  amongst  each  of the separate senses  assigned  to  among;  it does,  however, describe  amongst  as 'less  usual  in the  primary local sense than  among,  and, when so used, gener- ally  implying dispersion, intermixture, or shifting position'. Such  a  distinc- tion may  be  accepted  on  authority,  but can  hardly  be  made convincing  by quotations even  on the  liberal scale  of the  OED.  It  is remarkable,  at  any rate, 25",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

amphibol(og)y,"that  one of the  forms should  not by this time have driven  out the  other (cf.  on  and  upon, although  and  though, while  and  whilst, amid  and  amidst).  The survival  of  both  without  apparent differentiation may possibly  be  due  to the unconscious desire  for  euphony  or ease;  few  perhaps would  say  amongst strangers  with  among  to  hand;  amongst us  is easier  to  say than  among  us.  Some confirmation  of  this  is  found  by  com- paring  the  ratio borne by initial vowels to initial consonants after  amongst  with the corresponding ratio after  among; reckoned upon  the  icjth-c.  quotations in  the  OED, this ratio  is  four times as high  for  amongst  as for  among.  Though the total number  of  quotations  is too small  to  justify  the  belief  that  this proportion prevails generally,  it  prob- ably  indicates  a  tendency.  It  may  be said  .with  some confidence  that  (1) among  is the  normal word, (2)  amn-tgst is  more usual before  vowels^  but (3)  before  the,  which  so  commonly follows  as  easily  to  outnumber  all  other initials,  the two  forms  are  used  quite indifferently.

The mean- ing  of  analogy  in  logic  is inference or procedure based on the presumption that  things whose likeness in certain respects is known will  also  be found alike  or should be treated as alike, in respects about which knowledge is limited to one of  them.  It is perhaps the basis of most human conclusions, its liability to error being compensated for  by the frequency  with  which it is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
analogy,"the  only  form of reasoning available; but its literary, not its  logical,  value is what we now have to do  with.  Its literary  merits need not be pointed out to anyone who knows the Parables, or who has read the  essays  of Bacon or Montaigne,  full of  analogies  that  flash out for the length of a line or so and are  gone :  Money is like muck, not  good unless  it be spread.  What  does need pointing out is unfortunately its de- merit—the  deadly dullness of the elaborate artificial  analogy  favoured by those who think it necessary to write down to their audience and make their point plain to the meanest capacity. Specimens  fully bearing out this generalized  description  are too long to quote; but the following  gives  a fair idea  of the essential stupidity  of  these fabricated  analogies,  against which no warning can be too strong. Let it be read and compared  with  the money that  is like muck :  The  Government  are playing  the part of a man  entrusted  with the  work  of guarding a  door  beset  by enemies.  He  refuses  to let them in at  once, but  provides  them with a  large  bag of gold,  and at the same time hands them out  a  crowbar  amply  strong  enough  to break  down the  door.  That  is the Govern- ment's  idea of  preserving  the Union and safeguarding  the integrity of the United Kingdom. 2.  As an influence in word-forma- tion. In the making of words, and in the shape  that  they take,  analogy  is the chief  agent. Wanting a word to express about some idea a relation  that  we know by experience to be expressible about other ideas,  we  apply to the root or stem associated  with  it what strikes us  as  the same  treatment  that  has been applied to the others.  That  is, we make the new word on the  analogy  of the old; and in ninety-nine  cases  we make it right, being all old hands at the job;  for each of us, in the course of a day,  makes large numbers of words he has never seen in a dictionary or grammar, words for which his only warrant is merely an unconscious con- viction  that  they are  analogical.  Nearly every  inflexion is an instance; we are taught, perhaps,  that  the past of  will  is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
analogy,"would,  or the plural of  ox  is  oxen,  but not  that  the past  of inflate  is  inflated  or the plural  of  book  is  books ;  those forms we make when we want  them  by ana- logy,  and generally make  them  right. Occasionally,  however, we go wrong: The total  poll  midway in  December  was 16,244   so  tnat   upwards of half the electors  were  abstentients.  The writer wanted a  single  word for persons guilty of  abstention, and one too  that  would not, like  abstainer,  make us think of alcohol.  Dissension  came into his head as  rhyming  with  abstention;  if  that yields,  said he,  dissentients,  why should abstention  not yield  abstentients^  But the correspondence between  abstention and  dissension  is not quite so close as he assumed  ;  if  he  had remembered  dissen- tire  and  abstinere,  analogy would have led him to  abstinents  instead of to abstentients  and perhaps eventually to the conclusion  that  there  was no way out but to  write  half the  electors  ab- stained.  That  is a live newspaper in- stance of the fallibility of  analogy,  and dead specimens may be found in any etymological  dictionary—dead  in the sense  that  the unsoundness of their analogical  basis excites no attention as we hear the words. Who thinks of chaotic,  operatic,  dilation,  and  direful, as  malformations? Yet none of  them has  any right to exist  except  that  the men who made  them  thought of  eros as  a  pattern  for  chaos,  drama  for  opera, relate  for  dilate,  and  dread  for  dire, though  each  pattern  differed  in some essential  point  from the material to be dealt  with;  the objection to some of  the words is explained in the sepa- rate articles. These malformations, it is  true,  have now all the rights of words regularly  made. They have prospered, and none dare call  them  treason; but those who try their luck  with  absten- tients  and the like must be prepared to pass  for  ignoramuses.

LOVE  OF  THE LONG WORD  has led to the habit  of  writing,  e.g.,  We  anticipated this  crisis  when what  is  meant  is  that we foresaw  it; the  proper meaning  is that  we  took steps beforehand  to  meet it. 2.

The OED  has 9  separately numbered definitions,  and 35  quotations,  for anticipate.  None  of the  definitions, and  none  of  the quotations,  suggest  the possibility  of  such  a use as is  seen  in all  the  above newspaper extracts;  the writers have thought their sentences with  the  homely  expect,  which would have  served perfectly, and then written them  with  the  FORMAL  WORD  anticipate^, ANALOGY  has duped  them  into suppos- ing  that  since  it  vaguely resembles expect  in  sense  it  must  be  capable  of the same construction.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

apocope,"is  short.  The  word has come  to  denote any  short pithy statement containing a  truth  of  general  import  (OED).  It is distinguished  from  the  axiom,  which is  a  statement  of a  self-evident  truth, and  also  from  the  theorem,  which  is a demonstrable proposition  in  science and mathematics;  the  aphorism  con- cerns  itself  with  life and human nature, and its  truths  are incapable of scientific demonstration.  The  epigram,  on the other hand, though concerned  with life  like  the  aphorism,  and  possessing its terse and pointed form, is lacking  in general  import;  it is not the  statement of  a  general  truth.  Other  words  with much  the  same significance  as  aphor- ism  are  maxim, apophthegm, saying; and although these have sometimes been distinguished from  one  another —the  maxim being defined as contain- ing  not  only  a  general  truth  but  also advice  and admonition, and the apoph- thegm  or  saying  as an  aphorism  or maxim expressed  in  speech—these distinctions  of  the rhetoricians are  not of  much importance  and  have seldom been observed  in the  current usage  of the words.

lated.,"Followed  by  to  with  the  infini- tive  in the  senses  having an unfortunate tendency  (apt),  exposed  to  a  risk  (liable), the first  two of  these words  are so near  in  meaning  that  one of  them {liable)  is  often used where  the  other would  be  better.  It may  perhaps  be laid  down  that  apt  is the  right  one except  when  the  infinitive expresses not merely  an  evil,  but an  evil  that  is one  to the  subject. This  is so, and therefore  liable  is  right,  in:  We are  I. to  be  overheard  (being overheard  is an evil  to  us)  ;  The  goods  are  I.  to  suffer. It  is not so, and  therefore  apt  is the only  word,  in:  Curses  are a. to  come home  to  roost  (the  evil  is not to the curses,  but to the  curser);  Damage is  a. to be  done; Difficulties  are a. to occur  ;  Lovers'  vows are  a. to be  broken. It  is  usually  not so, and  therefore  apt is  usually  the  right word,  in:  He is a. to  promise  more  than he  can  perform  (but liable,  if  the evil suggested  is the  shame he  feels);  Cast iron  is a. to  break  (but liable,  if we are  sorry  for the  iron  and not  for its  owner).

Arab,"In British usage  apt  always implies a general  tendency; for  a  probability arising  from particular circumstances likely  is the word.  He is apt to be late for  his  engagements,  but  He is likely to be  late for his  engagement  if he does not start  soon.  In the second sentence  apt would be idiomatic in U.S. but not in Britain.  Prone  has the same  signifi- cance  as  apt,  but differs in being suit- able only for use  with  persons, as in the expression  accident-prone,  a pro- duct  of the motor-car age. The natural meaning of  calculated  is de- signed  to produce a certain result (a story  calculated  to make the  reader's  hair stand  on end),  often in the negative of unsuccessful  designs  (a  disguise not calculated  to  deceive  anyone),  and some- times ironically  (a  proposal  calculated to  have the most unexpected  results).

If it is desired  to intimate  that  a cook, tailor, hairdresser,  etc.,  or an artiste, makes his  occupation into a fine art,  artist, and not  artiste,  is the right word :  He is quite  an artist;  What  an artist! as.  i.

The reverse order (/  gave it up, as he only laughed at my  argu- ments)  is,  except  when the fact adduced is  one necessarily known to the hearer or reader and present to his mind (/ need  not  translate,  as  you know German), unpleasant to anyone  with  a literary ear.

as,"is  an art and  that  sentences require arrangement. The first  passage  quoted below  suggests  the  kind  of writer most liable to this weakness; the second  and third,  with  their successive as-clauses,  exhibit the total lack of ear that  accompanies it :  One is  pleased  to find that Mr. P. Gannon still  maintains his  form,  as he won the Open  Challenge cup  in  face of  such  opponents  as  ... /  The Sunningdale  man,  indeed,  put up a  most strenuous  fight, as his  i$4  equalled the total  of...

As to.  This has a legitimate  use— to bring into prominence at the begin- ning  of a sentence something  that without  it would have to stand later (As to Smith, it is  impossible  to  guess what line he will take);  it has, for instance,  been wrongly  omitted  in: Whether the  publishers  will  respond  to Sir  Charles  Stanford's  appeal or not it is too early to speak with any  confidence. A spurious imitation of legitimacy oc- curs when  as to  introduces what would even  without  it stand at the head of the sentence, as in :  As to how far such reinforcements  are available this is quite another  matter;  omit 'as to' and 'this', and the order is unaffected; the writer has  chosen to get out of the room by a fire-escape when the door was open. As to  is of course idiomatic when  to  is part  of an infinitive of result or pur- pose and  as  refers back to a preceding so.  He so acquitted himself as to  please everybody. Apart from this,  as to  is usually either a  slovenly substitute for some simple preposition  (Proper  notions as to  [of]  a woman's  duty,  j She had been  sarcastic as to  [about]  his hunting.  /  Piece  of  busi- ness  as to  [upon]  which Dr.  Thome  had been  summoned.  /  Bantered himself as to [on]  his own want of skill.  /  The manu- facturer  complains  that everything as to [concerning]  the future is left to the whim of the  Board  of Trade);  or it is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 6.,"4.  As if, as though.  These should ordinarily  be followed by the 'past' form of the conditional, and not by the present indicative  (would,  not  will; could,  not  can;  did,  not  does;  was  or were,  not  is; had  gone,  not  has  gone; knew,  not  knows).  The full form of the incorrect  It is scanned  curiously,  as if  mere  scanning  will  resolve  its nature  is It is scanned curiously, as  it would be scanned   if   mere  scanning  would resolve  its nature;  and the omission of it would be scanned  leaves  would resolve  unchanged.  As though,  about which the same demonstration is not possible,  is precisely equivalent to  as if,  and is subject to the same rule; and the rule applies to the still  more  ellipti- cal  use of either form in exclamations (As if,  or  As though, you didn't  [not don't]  know that!)  as well as to the use with  an expressed main sentence. The tendency to put the verb in a present tense is especially common after  it  looks or  seems.  Here  there  may be the justifi- cation  that  the clause  gives  a supposed actual fact; but sometimes the supposi- tion is admittedly  false:  It looks as if the  Party is  bringing  pressure  on Dr. Adenauer.  /  To the  observer  from with- out  it seems as if  there  has been  some lack  of  stage-management,  j It is not as though  a sound liquor is supplied. Is and  has  may pass in the first and second quotations, but the last  cries  out for  is  to be changed to  was  or  were. 5.  As,  relative pronoun. The distinc- tion between  as  the relative pronoun, capable of serving as subject or object of  a verb, and  as  the relative adverb, not capable of so serving, must be grasped  if a well-marked type of blun- der is to be avoided. Examples of the blunder are:  The  ratepayers have no direct  voice  in fixing the amount of the levy,  as is possessed  by the unions.  / With  a  speed  of eight knots,  as has been found practicable,  the  passage  would occupy  five days.  /  There  were  not two dragon  sentries keeping ward,  as  in magic  legend  are usually found  on  duty. If  these sentences, the faultiness of which will probably be admitted at sight,  are examined, it will be seen that  for each two cures are possible. One is to substitute for  as  an undoubted relative pronoun  (such as  or  which)  and write,  such as is  possessed;  which  has been  found practicable; such as are usually found.  The other is to insert a missing  subject or object  (as  one  is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
as,"possessed;  as  it  has  been  found  practicable to steam  ;  as  dragons  are usually found). Either method of correction suggests the same  truth,  that  the adverbial  as in these sentences is not a relative pronoun,  and has been wrongly treated as one. The fact is  that  when as  is used as a relative pronoun the antecedent is never a simple noun that  has already been  expressed (which must be represented by an ordinary  relative— such  as,  which,  zvho 3 that),  but a verb or verbal notion, or a previously unexpressed noun,  that  has to be gathered from the main sentence. Thus we cannot say  To affect poverty, as is now often affected  (i.e. which poverty is affected); but we can say To affect  poverty,  as is now often done (i.e.  which affecting is done). If this test  is applied to the incorrect sentences above,  it will be found  that  each ante- cedent of the supposed relative pro- noun is of the illegitimate kind, a simple expressed  noun— voice,  speed, sentries.  It may perhaps occur to the reader  that  a legitimate substitute for as is  possessed  by the unions  in the first example would be  as the unions have, and  that  as  then  represents  which  voice and consequently invalidates our rule. That  it seems  to  do  so,  however,  is  owing to a peculiarity of the verb  have. The ratepayers  possess  no  voice,  as the unions do;  the ratepayers  exercise  no  voice,  as the  unions do', the ratepayers have no voice,  as the unions  (not  do,  but)  have. Have  (in the sense  possess),  being never represented like other verbs by  DO,  is allowed, when used where  do  would be substituted for any other verb, to take the  construction proper to  do; as the unions  possess  it  or  do; as the unions exercise  one  or  do;  but  as the unions have  simply. On the other hand, failure to recog- nize  that  as  is a relative pronoun some- times produces mistakes of a different kind:  Epeiros,  as it is well known, was anciently inhabited by . . . (as =  which fact, and  it  is therefore impossible un- less  as  is omitted). 6. Omission of  as.

REGARD.,"7.  As  =  in the capacity of.  When this is used, care must be taken to avoid  the mistake corresponding to what  is  called  the  UNATTACHED  PARTI- CIPLE;  we can say  He  gave this advice as leader of the  opposition,  or  This  ad- vice  was given by him as leader, he  and him  supplying the  point  of attachment; but we cannot say  The advice which he tendered  to the  Peers  was given as  leader of  the  opposition.  The writer of the following  has fallen into this  trap through being in too great a hurry with  his  that  :  I should like to  say  that as a  social  worker in this field, without exception,  no  contraceptive  technique had been applied by any of the young women  who came to me for  assistance. 8.  As from  etc. An agreement, espe- cially  one for an increase of pay, is often said to come into effect  as from a  certain date.  That  is reasonable if it is  retrospective : the agreement is to be treated as if it had been made earlier. Otherwise the  as  is superfluous.  That curious compound preposition some- times used,  as  and  from,  is merely  silly, whatever the date may be. 9.  Case after  as.  It is a  matter  of no great practical importance, case being distinguishable only in a few pronouns, and these pronouns occur- ring  so seldom after  as  that  most of the examples given in illustration will have an  artificial air; but some points may be  noticed,  (a)  Sometimes a verb is to be supplied ; the right case must  then be used, or the sense may be spoilt; You hate her as much as I  implies  that I  hate her;  You hate her as much as me implies  that  you hate me.  (b) As  is never to be regarded as a preposition; the objective case after it, when right, is due either to the filling up of an elliptic sentence as in (a) or to causes explained in (c) and  (d); When such as her die, She  is not so tall as me,  may pass collo- quially  but not in  prose,  (c)  The",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

asset,"ashen.  See -EN  ADJECTIVES. Asian,  Asiatic. As a colourless adjec- tive for  Asia, Asian  is the older. Asiatic,  which later  largely  superseded it, originally had a  contemptuous nuance, especially when applied to a literary  style,  'prose  somewhat barbar- ously  rich  and overloaded' (M. Arnold). (For this the word  Asianic  has since been coined, defined by the OED Supp. as  'characterized  by the florid and inflated style of Asiatic Greeks in the  three  centuries before Christ'.) Modern preference for  Asian  over Asiatic (Asian Relations  Conference,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
the,"Afro-Asian Group)  is a mid-20th- c.  REVIVAL.  Asiatic  never wholly got rid of its taint, and the reversion to  Asian  was no  doubt  prompted  by the West's recognition of the expe- diency  of being polite to the East (cf. the disappearance of  Chinaman  and the conversion of  Eurasian  into  Anglo- Indian).

Thus  in- cubate,  at least in the sense in which its -able adjective is likely to be wanted, is  a technical rather than a literary word;  inculcable  is not instantly recog- nized as from  inculcate; inculpable  is both  likely to be understood as not culpable, and unlikely to be often wanted; and accordingly  incubatable, inculcatable,  inculpatable,  are  less  ob- jectionable than  incubable, inculcable, and  inculpable.

A short ex- planation may therefore be useful. We now know only too well  that Democritus,  the exponent of the atom- ic  theory nearly  2,500  years ago, was right when he maintained  that  matter should be regarded not as continuous but as composed of discrete particles. He called these  ocôixara  ârofia  (uncut- table bodies), and  atom  has been the name for  them  ever since. According to modern theory the atom, so small that  some hundred million of  them placed side by side would measure only  about an inch, may be compared to the solar system on a  minute  scale. Its  nucleus,  about one hundred  thou- sandth  part  of the whole, and com- posed of two types of particles,  protons and  neutrons,  corresponds to the sun. Circulating round it in orbits like the planets are bodies known as  electrons. The protons in the nucleus and the electrons circulating round it are electrically  charged, positively and negatively  respectively. There are the same  number of electrons as of protons and they carry charges of the same magnitude; and so, neutrons being uncharged, the atom as a whole is electrically  neutral. An atom is the smallest specific  unit of  a chemical element, and the ele- ments are distinguished from one another by the different numbers of protons in the nuclei of their atoms. A  molecule  is the smallest specific  unit of  a chemical compound, and is there- fore a combination of atoms.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Distinction between the forms is diffi- cult, but  with  regard to modern usage certain points may be made :  (i)  Wake is  the ordinary working verb (  You will wake the  baby  ; Something woke me up ; I  should like to be waked at 7.30  ;  Wake the  echoes),  for which the others are substituted to add dignity or formality, or to suit metre, or as in (3) or (5) below.  (2)  Wake  alone has (and that  chiefly in  waking)  the sense  be or  remain awake  (Sleeping  or waking; In our waking hours.)

(4) Waken  and  awaken  tend  to be re- stricted to the transitive sense;  when he  wakens  is rarer for  when he wakes than  that  zvill  waken  him  for  that will wake him.  (5) In the passive,  azvaken and  waken  are often preferred to  awake and  wake,  perhaps owing to uncer- tainty about the p.p. forms of the latter pair;  it wakened me  is rare for  it woke or  waked  me, but /  was wakened by it is  common for /  was  zvaked  or  woke  or woken  by it;  see  also  the alternative forms in (3) above.

 formation.,"A dictionary defini- tion  of  the  term  is  : The making from a  supposed derivative (as  lazy,  banting) of  the  non-existent word  (laze, bant) from which  it  might have come.  It is natural  to  guess  that  the words  scaven- ger,  salvage,  and  gridiron  are  formed from verbs  scavenge  and  salve  and a noun  grid,  and  consequently  to use those verbs  and  noun  if  occasion arises.  Those  who  first used  them, however, were mistaken,  and  were themselves making  the  words  out of what they wrongly took  for  their derivatives;  similarly  banting  is not formed from  bant,  but is the name first of  a  man, and  then  of  his system,  out of  which the verb  to  bant  was made by back formation. This will perhaps sufficiently   explain  the  references made here  and  there  to  this article. Some  back formations are  not  gener- ally  recognized  as  such, and have  the full  status  of  ordinary words,  e.g. diagnose  (from  diagnosis),  drowse  (from drowsy),  sidle  (from  sideling  =  side- long),  grovel  (from  grovelling,  an ad- verb),  resurrect  (from resurrection), and BURGLE  (from  burglar).

We speak of  barbaric taste, finery, splen- dour,  costume,  gold, hospitality, simpli- city,  strength,  health.

A  barbarism is  like  a lie; it has got the start of  us  be- fore  we  have  found it out, and we can- not  catch it. It is in  possession,  and our offers  of other  versions  come too  late. That  barbarisms  should  exist  is a pity. To  expend much  energy  on  denounc- ing  those that do  exist  is a  waste.  To create  them is a  grave  misdemeanour; and  the  greater  the need of the word that is  made,  the  greater  its  maker's guilt  if he  miscreates  it. A man of science  might  be expected  to  do on his great  occasion  what the  ordinary  man cannot  do  every  day, ask the  philo- logist's  help;  that the  famous  eocene- pleistocene  names  were made by 'a  good classical  scholar'  (see  Lyell  in DNB) shows  that word-formation is a matter for  the  specialist.

"baroque,",,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 rococo.,"The  term  baroque (misshapen pearl) was applied, at first contemptuously but later respectfully, to a style of architecture  that  originated in  Rome in the early  17th  c. and showed an  audacious  departure  from the tradi- tions of the  Renaissance.  Asymmetry of design,  luxuriance of ornament, strange or broken curves or lines, and poly- chromatic richness were its main fea- tures. The word was later extended to the  other  visual arts of the baroque period, which is generally regarded as having  lasted to the middle of the  18th c.  The best known early exponents are Borromini  in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, and Rubens in painting. Rococo  (rock-work) is sometimes treated  as synonymous  with  baroque, but is more properly confined to a later development of it, especially in France,  lighter and more fanciful, and with  ornament even  less  related to structure.  The  characteristics  of baroque are grandeur, pomposity, and weight; those of rococo are inconse- quence,  grace,  and lightness. Baroque aims  at astounding, rococo at amusing. It has become  fashionable  to apply the word  baroque  to literature and music  also.  What  it is intended to mean when so used has been the subject of much  argument and little agreement, except,  it seems,  that  the poetry of Crashaw and the music of Vivaldi are typically  baroque. Such definitions of baroque poetry  as  have  been  attempted, as  for instance  that  its marks are  'in- stability,  mobility, metamorphosis and the domination of decor', are unlikely",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
barrage,"to  give  the ordinary reader confidence that  he will recognize it  with  certainty. The application of the  term  to  music is  even more recent. It started in Ger- many,  and its propriety is not univer- sally  accepted.  'It  is clear  that  a word professing  to embrace such various products as the later madrigals and Handel's operas, Peri's melodrama and Bach's  Art of Fugue, has no justifica- tion  beyond  mere  convenience' (Grove's  Dictionary  of  Music,  1954  éd.). This quest for the meaning of  baroque when applied to the non-visual arts is the more  difficult  because those so using  the word do not always make it dear,  even, one suspects, to  them- selves,  whether to  them  it is a chrono- logical  term,  meaning any work pro- duced during the baroque period, or a descriptive one, meaning a work  with baroque characteristics, whenever pro- duced, or a  mixture  of the two, mean- ing  a  work  with  baroque characteristics, produced during the baroque period. The Muse of History seems now to have been infected by her sisters of Poetry and Music. From an important historical  work recently published a reviewer quotes  b.  absolutism,  b. raison d'état,  and  an adventure  in  b.  power politics,  and he adds,  'There  is a strong case  for persuading historians to use the  epithet  baroque  with  restraint, for it is fast becoming as devoid of mean- ing  as  feudal'.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 basic.,"These  unEnglish-look- ing  adjectives, neither of which existed before the  19th  c, were manufactured as  adjuncts to certain technical uses of the noun  base  in botany, chemistry, and architecture, where  fundamental would have been misleading. But a tendency  then  arose to allow these up- starts to  supplant  fundament  al,  with  its 500-year  tradition, in those general and figurative contexts in which they are unnecessary  and incongruous. No doubt  those who started the fashion hoped  that  what they had to say would be more convincing if seasoned  with  a pinch of the up to date and scientific. The native element of  basal  and  basic is  seen  in  :  The elytra have a  basal  gib- bosity;  The basal  portion  of the main petiole;  Its capital  resting  on its basic plinth;  Basic salts,  phosphates,  oxides. Basal  in a figurative sense has now dropped out of favour, but  basic,  with the help of such established phrases as b. dyes, industry,  petrol  allowance,  slag, and  steel,  and now  BASIC  ENGLISH, is in a  fair way to win its victory  over  funda- mental.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 English,"51 vented  Volapuk  in  1879  and L. L. Zamenhof  who  invented  Esperanto  in 1887.  But the likelihood  that  any such language  will in fact be universally used has remained very remote indeed. As Ogden has said,  'an  artificial language  still awaits a millennium in which conversion shall cease to be confined to a few thousand  en- thusiasts'.  His approach is different. Instead of inventing a new language he would use  English,  with  its vocabulary drastically  limited and its grammar simplified, as an international auxiliary language.  He  had  of course no thought that  basic English ever should or could supersede literary  English;  his aim was to provide the peoples of all  countries, nearly  a quarter of whom already have some knowledge of  English,  with  a vehicle of communication  with  one another in the ordinary affairs of  life. The vocabulary consists of 850 words chosen as capable of doing, alone  or in combination, all the es- sential  work of 20,000. It is claimed for   the system  that  anyone who masters it will have at his command 'idiomatic  English  with  no literary pretensions but clear and precise at the level for which it was  designed'. It is obvious  that  ordinary prose, when translated into a language  with so  limited a vocabulary, cannot retain its elegance or its rhetorical appeal, and  Basic  English has suffered from being an  easy  target for  ridicule  by those who misunderstand its object. To criticize it on this account is unreasonable;  it should be judged only  by its  aptitude  to achieve the purpose put  thus  by an enthusiastic advocate, Sir Winston  Churchill: 'It  would certainly be a grand con- venience for us all to be able to move freely  about the world and to be able to  find  everywhere a medium, albeit primitive,  of  intercourse and under- standing'.  But Ogden's system, after a  promising start, has  languished— 'bedevilled by  officials'  said its in- ventor.

The  rule that  the  complement must  be in the same  case  as  the  subject  of  the  copula {You   believed  that  it  zvas  he;  You believed  it  to be  him) is  often  dis- regarded  in  talk  {It  zvasn't  me),  but should  be  observed  in  print,  except where  it  would  be  unnatural  in dialogue.  The  temptation   in its simplest forms  is  rare,  but  may occur; Meredith,  for  instance, writes  /  am she,  she  me,  till death  and  beyond  it, where  the  ungrammatical  me  is not satirically  intended. This should  not be imitated. 7.  Forms.

 large.,"The differences in meaning and usage cannot be exhaus- tively  set forth; but a few points may be made clear.  See  also   SMALL. Roughly,  the notions of mere size and quantity have been transferred from  great  to  large  and  big;  great is  reserved for  less  simple meanings, as  will be explained below.   Large and  big  differ, first, in  that  the latter is  more familiar and colloquial, and secondly,  in  that  each has additional senses— large  its own Latin sense of generous  (cf.  LARGESS),  and  big  certain of  the senses proper to  great,  in which it tends to be used sometimes as a colloquial  and sometimes as a half- slang  substitute. It will be best to classify  the chief uses of  great  as the central word,  with  incidental com- ments on the other two. 1.  With  abstracts expressing things that  vary in degree,  great  means  a high degree  of  {g.  care,  ignorance,  happiness, tolerance,  charity, joy,  sorrow,  learning, facility,  generosity,  comfort).  Big  is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 not,"idiomatic  with  any of these; and though  large  is used  with  tolerance, charity,  and  generosity,  it is in a special sense—broad-minded   or  prodigal. With  words of this kind  that  happen themselves to mean  size  or quantity {size,  quantity, bulk,  magnitude,  amount, tonnage)  large  and  big  are  sometimes used, though neither is as idiomatic as great,  and  big  is  slangy  or at best colloquial. 2.  Great  may be used not to imply size,  but to indicate  that  the person or thing in question has  the  essential quality of his or its  class  in a high degree;  so  a g. opportunity,  occasion.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

big,"friend,  landowner, majority,  school- master,  shot{shootcr),  nuisance,  stranger, brute,  fool,  haul,  race  (contest),  under- taking,  success,  linguist, age.  Here  large could be substituted  with  landowner, majority,  haul,  and  undertaking,  but merely because a large quantity of land,  votes, fish, or money is involved; big  could stand  with  the same four on the same ground; it is increasingly used  also  with  most of the others. This is  unfortunate;  a  great  fool  should mean a very foolish fool, and  a  big  fool one whose stature belies his wits. 3.  A  great  has the meaning  eminent, of  distinction,  and  the  g.  the meaning chief, principal,  especial  {a g. man', g. houses',  a  g.  family; theg. advantage,  or thing,  is);  and from these comes the use  of  great  as a distinctive  epithet  {the g.  auk; G. Britain; Alexander the G.; the  Lord  G.  Chamberlain),  with  the idea  of size either absent or quite sub- ordinate. In these senses  large  cannot be used, though it would stand  with many of the same words in a different sense  {a g. family  has distinguished, but  a  I.  family  numerous, members). Here  again  the substitution of  big  for great  makes for confusion;  a  big man should refer to the  man's  size,  or be extended only (as in  the big men of the trade;  cf.  large  with  landowner  etc. in 2)  to express the quantity of his stock or transactions. But  thanks  no  doubt to the fondness of modern journalism for  short words and snappy phrases  big is  now so often used as a distinctive epithet  instead of  great,  even when difference of size is not the salient point of distinction,  that  it is losing its slangy  flavour.  The big  race,  a big occasion,  The Big  Five  (banks). 4.   Finally,  great  does sometimes mean  of remarkable  size—the  sense that  it has for the most  part  resigned to  large  and  big;  but it is so used only where size is to be represented as causing  emotion.  Large  and  big  give the cold fact;  great  gives  the fact coloured  with  feeling; e.g.  He hit me with a  great  stick  is  better  than  with a  large  or  big stick,  if I am angry about its  size;  but in  Perhaps  a big  or  large stick  might do  it would be impossible",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In  their original and simplest form they were collusive transactions  by  which  a  person liable to high rate  of  surtax would avoid liability  by  selling investments  cum dividend  and  buying  them  back  at a lower price after  the  dividend had been paid  to the  purchaser;  in  this  way he converted what would have been  tax- able  income  in his  hands into  a non- taxable  gain.  The  other party  to the deal  would  be  either  a  tax-exempt  body (e.g.  a  charity)  or  someone  (e.g. a dealer  in  securities)  who,  unlike  the ordinary  taxpayer,  was  taxable  on his gains  from transactions  in  securities and  so  could  set off his  loss  on  resale against  his  liability.

B.-washing  came from America as  a response to the need for a con- venient word to describe certain modern methods of indoctrination, especially  those employed by the Chinese on prisoners of war in Korea.  The phrase itself is as old as Shakespeare.  'It's monstrous labour', said  Octavius at the carouse on  Pom- pey's Galley, 'when I wash my brain and it grows more foul'.

What  difference  there  is  must  be in meaning; yet how close they are in this respect is shown by their  both having  narrow  as their usual opposite, and  both  standing in the same relation, if  in any at all, to  long.  Nevertheless, though they may often be used in- differently (a  b.  or  a  w.  road;  three  feet to.  or  b.),  there  are  (i)  many words  with which one may be used but not the other,  (2) many  with  which one is more idiomatic than the  other  though the sense  is the same, (3) many  with  which either can be used, but not  with  pre- cisely  the same sense  as  the  other.  These numbered points are illustrated below. The explanation seems to be  that wide  refers to the distance  that  sepa- rates the limits, and  broad  to the ampli- tude  of  what  connects  them.  When  it does not  matter  which of these is in our minds, either word does equally well; if the verges are far apart, we have a w. road; if  there  is an ample surface,  we have a b. road ; it is all one.

Of the words  that  admit  b.  but refuse w.  some are of the simple kind  (b. blades,  spearheads,  leaves;  the b.  arrow), but  with  many some secondary notion such as generosity or downrightness or neglect of the  petty  is the representa- tive of the simple idea of amplitude (b.  daylight, B.

The sense  'a  few leaves of printed  matter  stitched together' has always  belonged in English to  p., though it has by the side of this general sense  the special one (different from the French) 'p. bearing on some ques- tion of  current  interest (esp. in politics or theology)'.

The answer is  that  but was  originally  a preposition meaning outside, but is now usually made a conjunction, the subjective case being preferred after it when grammatically needed. Out of a  large  collection of examples of  but  followed by an in- flected pronoun, 95 % showed the con- junctional use;  Whence all b. he  (not him) had fled  exemplifies, in fact, the normal modern literary use though the OED  says  that  the prepositional use is equally  correct. The fact seems to be that  all but him  is used (a) by those who either do not know or do not care whether  it is right or  not—and  accord- ingly  it is still  gcod  colloquial—,  and (b)  by the few who, being aware  that b.  was originally prepositional, are  also proud  of their knowledge and willing to air  it—and  accordingly it is still pedantic-literary. It is  true  that  the conjunctional use has prevailed owing partly to the mistaken notion  that  No one  knows it b. me  is the same sort of questionable grammar as  It is me;  but it has prevailed, in literary use, and it is  in itself legitimate  ;  it would there- fore be well for it to be universally accepted. 2.

capitals,"titles of persons, ranks,  offices,  institu- tions,  countries, buildings, books, plays,  etc., whether general or par- ticular, singular or  plural—and  for the whole  of such titles. King  of the  Belgians,  Dukes of Bur- gundy,  Admiral of the Fleet, a Prime Minister, the Home Secretary,  Bish- ops of Durham, the Attorney- General, the Royal Society, the North-West  Frontier, the Western Powers,  St. Paul's Cathedral. [Some  prefer lower  case  when the titles are used  generally  or in the plural : dukes of Burgundy, a prime minis- ter, bishops of Durham, an attorney- general. Against  this practice is the fact  that  it cannot be consistently followed  with- out occasional ambiguity: for example, an  admiral of the  fleet  is not  necessarily identical  with  an Admiral of the Fleet, nor a foreign secretary  with  a Foreign Secretary.  Another recent tendency in certain quarters is to capitalize only half  of a title, as in the following, which surely  qualify as titles by now : south-east Asia, the western Powers, the welfare State.] (ii)  When  only  part  of a  title  is given the practice of retaining a capital for the  'particular'  but dropping it for the 'general'  is  fairly  common and, though any  form of hair-splitting is liable to cause  more trouble than it is  worth, usually  harmless. Thus: the Duke (also 'the Dukes' if they have  been specified), the  Bishop,  the Admiral, the Cathedral. But kings,  princes, dukes, a bishop, a cathedral. [On the other hand, the number of anti-capitalists  who would have lower case  for  both  sets of the above is far from  negligible.] (iii)  In reference to institutions, bod- ies,  etc., it is desirable, when their names  are repeated in shortened form, to retain the capital for the shortened title. For example: The Commissioners of Inland Revenue reconsidered the  matter. .  » . Eventually the Commissioners agreed  to ...",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

[It would be not unusual to find, on their recurrence,  the  commissioners,  the society,  though possibly not  the assem- bly  .  Which  again  implies inconsistency ; whereas the retention of capitals makes also  for easier reference and avoids possible  ambiguity.] (iv)  With  the  fairly  numerous words that  have a more restricted (or con- crete) sense as well as a commoner (or abstract) sense, the invariable use of lower case for the latter and capital for the  former—irrespective  of singular/ plural or particular/general distinc- tions—is  recommended. Such words, amongst  many others, are : state (= condition, circumstances) State (  =  organized community)  ; power (= strength etc.) Power (  = powerful nation)  ; government  (=  the function of governing)  Government (= the body  That  governs)  ; minister, ministry  (religious)  Minis- ter, Ministry (political) ; church (= the building) Church (= the body); east,  west, western, etc. (directional) East,  West,  Western, etc. (ethno- logical); underground  (below  ground, generally)  Underground (of  rail- ways). [The particular/general criterion al- ready  referred to is often applied here : e.g.  the Government,  but  a  government and  governments',  the Minister,  but  a minister  and  ministers —all  in the politi- cal  sense. This is surely to draw the dividing-line  in the wrong place. The same  applies to the common practice of  reverting to lower case when such a word is used adjectivally, for example, a  government  appointment;  to which  a Government  appointment  is to be pre- ferred.] (v)  There are a few words normally requiring  an initial capital  that,  when",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

capitals,"applied to common objects, exchange the  capital for a small  letter.  Most of them  are place-names (or adjectives formed therefrom)  that  have in course of  time  lost their purely local  associa- tion. I have in mind 'india-rubber', 'brussels   sprouts',   'roman   type', 'french windows', Venetian blinds'; and  readers will no  doubt  be able to supply plenty of others. (vi)  There is (or was until lately) a convention in certain quarters of  print- ing  the names of streets etc. as  'Regent- street',  'Portland-place', 'Shaftesbury- avenue',  'Berkeley-square', and so on. Why 'street', 'road', etc., should in this one connexion  fail  to conform  with  the normal rule for the use of capitals in full  titles has always been a mystery to me; and the insertion of the hyphen seems  peculiarly gratuitous. The streets themselves are not labelled in this way, nor do their names generally so appear on advertisements, buses, Under- ground stations, notepaper headings, visiting-cards,  and the like. The  thing seems  quite pointless; and when we get,  for instance, 'Charing Cross-road' —I  have seen it printed even 'Charing cross-road'—the  result is a  silly  ambi- guity.  There are  signs  that  this irritat- ing  practice is beginning to decline, so let us hope  that  'Regent Street' and 'Shaftesbury  Avenue' will soon be the invariable  form and  that  we may say farewell  to 'Leicester-square'. If  this whole topic should seem to have  been unduly laboured, some re- sponsibility  belongs to the journal  that I  have always taken, and still take for the most  part,  as the soundest guide to modern  usage.

But the word had appeared] in U.S. fic- tion in contexts in which it was clearly intended to have a quite different meaning—that  of rapid movement. Henry  heard the  Ford  taxi  coming  out of the  side  street  and saw it  careening  up on to  the dock.  The taxi was conveying gangsters  from a bank they had robbed to a boat they hoped to escape in, and as  the bank's alarm siren was already sounding  we may presume  that  the author's intention was to indicate very rapid movement indeed.

 carousel.,"These words are often confused.  Carousal  (with  the stress  on the second syllable) is an  -AL NOUN  formed from  carouse —unneces- sarily  since  carouse  is itself a noun as well as a  verb—and  means a drinking- bout;  it is said to be derived from the German  gar aus,  'no  heel taps'.  Carou- sel  (with  the stress on the last  syllable), sometimes spelt  carrousel,  means a tournament; in U.S. it is used for what we call a merry-go-round. It comes from the Italian  corosello,  which, ac- cording  to Skeat, is a  corrupt  form of garosello  = rather quarrelsome.

The  first spelling,  still  the  commonest  except  in technical books following  French authorities, should  be  preferred  if  only as  keeping  the  pronunciation right. cartel,  in the old  senses  (a  challenge, or  an  agreement  for the  exchange  of prisoners)  is  pronounced  kar'tel;  in the modern sense  of  manufacturers' combine  it  represents German  Kartell, and  was  accordingly disposed  at  first to accent  the  last syllable,  but  has now moved  far  enough towards  the old pronunciation  to  give equal stress  to both. case.  There  is  perhaps  no  single word so  freely resorted  to  as  a  trouble-saver, and consequently responsible  for so much  flabby writing.  The  following extract  from  a  legal treatise,  in  which the individual uses  are  comparatively justifiable, shows  how the  word  now slips  off the pen  even  of an  educated writer  :  In  the  majority  of  cc. where  re- prisals  have been the  object,  the  blockade has been instituted  by a  single State, while  in  cc.  of  intervention  several  powers have taken part; this  is  not,  however, necessarily  the  c. To obviate  the  suspicion of an intoler- ant desire  to  banish  it  from  the lan- guage,  let it be  admitted  that  case  has plenty  of  legitimate uses,  as in  :  In  your c.  I  would  not  hesitate',  A bad c. of blackmailing;  I am  only putting  a c; Circumstances  alter  cc.  ;  In c. of  fire, give  the  alarm ;  Take  brandy  with  you in  c. of  need;  The  plaintiff has  no  c.  ; What  succeeds  in one c.  may  fail  in another;  Never overstate your  c; In  no c.  are  you  to  leave  your post;  It  would be excusable  for a  starving  man,  but  that was not your  c;  There  are  seven  cc. of polio.  ;  In  any  c. I  will  come. The  bad  uses  are due  sometimes  to the lazy impulse  to get the  beginning of  a  sentence down  and  to let the  rest work itself  out as it  may,  and  some- 76   case times  to a  perverted  taste  for  long- windedness,  PERIPHRASIS,  or  ELEGANT VARIATION.  It  will  be  seen  that  in  the case  o/,the  worst offender, can often  be simply struck  out  (brackets  are  used  to show this),  and  often avoided  by the most trifling change, such  as  the  omis- sion  of  another word (also bracketed). Many examples  are  given,  in  the  hope that  any  writer  who has  inspected  the misshapen brood  may  refuse  to  bring more  of  them  into  the  world:  Older readers  will,  at  least  (in the  c. of)  those who  abhor all  Jingoist  tendencies,  regret that  the  authors have  . . .  /  He  has used this underplot  before  in  (the  c. of)  '  The Fighting  Chance 1 '.  /  That  he  could  be careful  in  correcting  the  press  he  showed in(the c. of) the 'Epistle  to  John Driden'.l In the cc. above noted, when two or  more handlings  of the  same subject  by the author exist,  the  comparison  of  the  two usually  suffices  to  show how little vamp- ing  there  is  in  (the  c. of)  the latter.  /  (In the c.  of)  Pericles  (,  the play)  is  omitted.  / (In  the c. of)  cigars  sold  singly (they) were  made  smaller,  j  (In  the  c. of  Purvey his) name  was  first mentioned  in  con- nexion with Bible translation  in  IJ29 (Purvey's).  /  There  are  many  (cc.  of) children  who have lost their parents and (of)  parents who do not know the where- abouts  of  their children.  /  Mr.  Mintoff has  demanded  full employment  in  the  c. of  all dockyard  employees  (for all  dock- yard  employees).  /  This  is the  first disaster  in  the  c. of a  Viscount air-liner (to  a  Viscount air-liner).  /  In  the  c.  of no  poet  is  there  less difference between the poetry  of  his youth  and  that  of  his later years  (No  poet  exhibits  less).  / Even  in  the purely Celtic areas only  in two  or  three cc.  do the  first  bishops  bear Celtic names  (only  two  or  three  of the first bishops bear).  /  That  in  all  public examinations acting  teachers  in  every  c. be  associated  with the  Universities  (teach- ers  be  always associated).  /  In  many (cc.  of)  largely frequented buildings,  as much dust as this may be extracted every week.

" 3,","WHO AND  WHOM  i,  2. To those warn- ings  the reader is referred for practical purposes, and the present article can be devoted to a confession of faith in case as  an enduring fact, a miscellaneous collection of quotations showing  that  it cannot quite be trusted to take care of itself,  and a glance at  the  conditions that  make mistakes most likely. 2.  The status of  case.  Is  case,  then, 77   cases a  notion permanently valuable and in- evitably  present, or can we, and may we as well, rid our minds of it? We know  that  grammarians are often ac- cused, and indeed often guilty, of fog- ging  the minds of  English  children with  terms and notions  that  are essen- tial to the understanding of Greek and Latin  syntax, but have no bearing on English.  We know  that  the work  done by  the  classical  case-endings has been in  large  part  transferred in  English  to two substitutes : the difference between the nominative and the accusative (or subject and object) is indicated mainly by  the order in which it arranges its  words;  and the dative, ablative, locative,  and such  cases,  are replaced by  various prepositions. We know  that English  had once case-forms for nouns as  well as pronouns, and  that  neverthe- less  it found  them  of so little use  that it has let  them  all disappear. We know that,  if the novelists are to be trusted, the uneducated find the case-endings even of pronouns  superfluous.  'Me and my mate likes ends' said the ruffian who divided  the  rolypoly between him- self  and his  ally  and left their guest the hiatus; he had no use for /, even when the place to be filled was  that  which belongs  to the subject, and the instinct of  case,  if it exists untaught, might have been expected to operate. We know, lastly,  that  not everyone who has learnt grammar  enough  to  qualify as journal- ist  or novelist is quite  safe  on his  cases when the test is a little more severe than in  Me and my mate. Is  the upshot  that  case is moribund, that  our remaining case-forms are doomed to extinction,  that  there  is behind  them  no essential notion or instinct of case itself,  that  no fuss whatever need be made about the matter,  that  the articles of which a list was  given above are much ado about nothing, and  that  the right  pohcy  is to let the memory of case fade away as soon  as we can agree whether / or  me, she  or  her, who  or  whom,  is to be the survivor  of its pair?  Possibly  it is; SUBJUNCTIVES  are nearly dead; case too may  be mortal; but  that  fight to a finish between / and  me  and the other",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
cases,"pairs will be a lengthy affair, and for as  long as it lasts the invisible cases will have  their  visible champions to muster round. Meanwhile let me confess my faith  that  case visible and invisible is an essential of the English language, and  that  the right policy is not to wel- come neglect of its rules, but to de- mand  that  in the broadcasts, the news- papers, and the novels, from which most of us imbibe our standards of language,  they should be observed. 3.  Temptations.  A. First in fre- quency and deadliness comes the per- sonal  pronoun in a place requiring the objective case followed by a relative that  must  be subjective. Examples: Three  years of dining are a preliminary for  he  who would defend his fellows.  / Should  not a Christian community re- ceive  with open arms  he  who comes out into the world with clean hands and a clean  heart?  /  They  came to fight in  order to  pick up the challenge of  he  who had said  'Our  future lies on the  water'.  / In these the  temptation  has been to regard  he-who  as a single word  that surely  cannot need to have the ques- tion of case settled twice over for it; and hazy notions of something one has  heard of in  classical  grammar called relative attraction perhaps induce a comfortable feeling  that  one will be safe  whether  one writes  he  or  him.  That is  a  delusion;  neither relative attraction nor inverse attraction (the right  term here) is a name to conjure  with  in modern English grammar, though the textbooks  can muster a Shakespearian and Miltonic example or two; in mod- ern grammar they  are  only polite names for elementary blunders. All  the  fore- going  examples should have  him  in- stead of  he. B.  The  next  temptation  is to assume, perhaps  from  hearing   It  is me corrected to  It is I,  that  a subjective case  cannot be wrong after the verb to  be. I saw a young  girl  gazing about, somewhat  open-mouthed and  confused, whom I  guessed  {correctly)  to  be  she whom I had come  to  meet.  /  It is not likely that other and inferior works  were done  at the same time by an impostor pretending  to be  he. / In these examples",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 ,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
cases,"it is not  to  be  that  decides the case of she  and  he;  it is  whom  and  impostor,  and her  and  him  must  be  substituted. C. It is hard not to sympathize  with the victims of the  next  trap.  One  comes round  again to the problem of  Kant — he,  too, a  cosmopolitan  like Goethe.  /  It is sad to  look  in  vain  for a  perambulator in Nursemaids'  Walk,  and to discover only one solitary  person,  and  he  a sentry, on  the steps of the Albert Memorial. Appositions such  as  'him,  too, a cos- mopolitan', 'and him a sentry', do sound as if one was airing one's know- ledge  of the concords. Well, perhaps it is  better  to air one's knowledge  than one's ignorance of  them  ; but the escape from  both  is to be found in evading the pronoun  (another  cosmopolitan,  or  also a  cosmopolitan)  or sacrificing the appo- sition  (and  he was a sentry). D. The invisibility of case in nouns and pronouns  tempts  us to try some- times  whether  they may  not  be made to serve two masters, as in Oliver Cromwell's  What  you call a gentleman and is nothing  else,  and St. Paul's  Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have  entered  into the heart of man,  the things  which God hath  prepared  for them that love him.  Modern examples are:  A plan which I  liave  often tried and has never failed me.  /  It gave a cachet  of  extreme  clericalism  to the  Irish party which it does not  deserve,  but must  prejudice  it not a little in the  eyes  of English  radicalism,  j Yet the coal is there  in abundant quantities, and there is nothing  the world  wants  so much or  can be dispensed  with  such  handsome  profit to  those who produce it.  In the verse from  Corinthians, things  has to serve seen-and-heard  as object, and  have en- tered  as subject.  1  Cor.  ii. 9 is the reference,  and  a glance at the R.V. with  its  which  in italics shows  that  the Revisers  did not regard its grammar as passable.  The NEB translators avoid the issue by recasting the sentence so as  to confine  things  to the subjective case.  The last example has the pecu- liarity  that  the word whose case is in question, viz.  that,  not only has no distinguishable  cases,  but is not on show at all; but the sentence is un-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
cast(e),"grammatical unless it is inserted twice —nothing  that  the  world  wants so much) or  that  can be  dispensed.  See also  THAT rel.  pron.  6,  WHAT  3, and  WHICH  2. E.  Another  trap  is the compound subject or object; when instead of a single  pronoun  there  are a pronoun and a noun to be handled, the case often goes wrong where if the pronoun had been alone  there  would have been no danger.  By that time Mr. Mac- donald  will be in  possession  of the decision  of the Conservative Party, and it will then be for  he and his advisers to  take a  decision.  Even the divider of the rolypoly, who can  easily  be be- lieved to have said  Me and my mate likes,  would never have said  Me likes', still  less  could we have had here  It will be  for he to take. F.  Let  Gilbert's  future wife be  whom she  may.  This  example is a little  more complicated, but of a kind  that  not in- frequently presents itself. The  tempta- tion is to look before and after, and doubt  in which direction the governing factor is to be found. We first, perhaps, put aside the  error  of supposing  that  be requires  a  subjective, i.e. who, and  re- member  that  let  puts  wife  in the objec- tive, which raises a presumption  that the same case will follow, i.e.  whom. But  then  it perhaps occurs to us  that the  part  to be played by  who{m)  is  that of  complement to  may  (Jbe),  which ought to be in the same case as  she. In this difficulty the last resource is to write  the sentence in full,  Let Gilbert's tvife  be her who she may be',  and the insertion of the  omitted  her  having provided the first  be  with  the objective complement  that  it requires, we find ourselves able to  write  who  as the sub- jective complement required by the second  be.

Idiom is conservative, standing in the ancient ways, insisting  that  its  property is  sacrosanct,  permitting  no jot or tittle of  alteration in the shape of its  phrases. Analogy  is progressive,  bent  on  extend- ing  liberty, demanding  better  reasons than use and  wont  for respecting the established, maintaining  that  the mat- ter is  what  matters and the form can go hang. Analogy perpetually wins, is for ever successful in recasting some piece of  the cast iron, and for  that  reason no article in this book is likely to be sooner out of date in some of its exam- ples than this. Idiom as perpetually renews the fight, and  turns  to defend some  other  object of assault.  'I  doubt that  it ever happened', 'He is regarded an  honest man',  'He  was  quoted  to have said', 'A hardly won victory', 'Hanker to learn the  truth',  'The state to which we have arrived',  'With  a view  of establishing  himself'—all  these, says  Idiom, are outrages on English; correct  them  please to 'I  doubt  whether it ever happened', 'He is regarded  as  an honest man', 'He was  quoted  as having said',  'A  hard-won  victory', 'Hanker after learning  the  truth',  'The state  at which  we  have  arrived',  'With  a view to  establishing himself.

Not  that  Analogy, and those whom it influences,  are offenders so deliberate and conscious as this description of them  might seem to  imply  ; they  treat regard  like  consider  not because they choose  to flout the difference  that Idiom observes, but because it comes natural to  them  to disregard distinctions that  they have not noticed. In  ANAL- OGY  2 it has been pointed out  that Analogy  has very important functions to perform apart from waging its war upon Idiom; and therefore the admis- sion  that  this book is  wholly  partisan in  that  war need not be interpreted as a  condemnation of  analogy  always and everywhere. The Analogy  that  wars against  Idiom is unsound or hasty or incomplete  analogy. The cast-iron nature of idiom may now be illustrated by a few phrases, shortened down to the  utmost,  in which some change  that  to the eye of reason  seems of slight importance has converted  English  into something else : He did it on his own   ACCORD;  CON- TENTED  himself by  saying;  LEST  the last state becomes worse than the first; Is to a great  MEASURE  true;  Had every MOTIVE in  doing  it; The  RESENTMENT I  feel to this  Bill;  We must  RISE  equal to the occasion; Fell  SHEERLY  down; Stood me in splendid  STEAD;  Guests came by  THE  hundreds; You need not BROOD  about  that  now; He  ADMITTED to his financial manipulations; It is not PROBABLE  to happen.

But it is  better to accept  the  fact  that  cavalcade,  like many other words,  has  broken  its etymological  bounds than  to try to drive  it  back  with  such  a  barbaric weapon  as  motorcade,  said  to  have been invented  by the  Salvation Army  and shyly  adopted  by  The  Times  with apologetic  inverted  commas.

We substitute it for stop  when we want our language to be dignified;  it is now poetic, rhetorical, formal,  or old-fashioned, though not sufficiently  so  to  have such labels at- tached to it in dictionaries. No effort should be made to keep words of this kind at work; they should be allowed to go into honourable retirement, from which the poets and the rhetoricians can  summon  them  at need. For the guidance  of anyone who still wants to use the word it is  worth  remark- ing  that  cease  to  trouble,  cease  from troubling,  and  cease  troubling  oxe  equally idiomatic.  See  FORMAL  WORDS. -ce,  -cy. Among the hundreds of words corresponding to actual or pos- sible  adjectives or nouns in -ant or -ent, large  numbers now present no choice of  form: no one hesitates between avoidance,  forbearance,   admittance, magnificence,  coincidence,  or  intelli- gence,  and a form in -cy; nor between buoyancy,  constancy, vacancy, agency, decency,  or  cogency,  and a form in -ce.   But in many  cases  it may easily  happen  that  one has doubts which is the right form, or whether one is as good as the other, or whether both  exist but in different  senses  :  per- sistence  or  persistency!  competence  or competency}  consistence  or  consistency} When  there is  doubt  about a  word  not given  in its place in this book, and  again when one is given  without  further com- ment  than  See  -CE, -CY,  it is to be pre- sumed  that  either -ce  or  -cy may be used; but three generalities may be added. First,  that  short words favour -cy,  and longer ones  -ce  ; it was not by design,  but by a significant accident, that  all the -cy words given above as having  no -ce alternatives were metri- cal  matches for  buoyancy.  Secondly, that  many words tend to use the -ce form in the singular, but  -des  rather than  -ces  in  the  plural, e.g.  irrelevance, but  irrelevancies.  And thirdly,  that euphony often decides, in a particular context, for one or the other ending.

And on the third point convincing examples will be found under  TRANS- PARENCE. Articles in which differentiation be- tween the two forms is recorded as existing  or recommended are CON- SISTENCE,  DEPENDENCE, EMERGENCE, INDEPENDENCE,  INDIFFERENCE, PER- MANENCE,  PERSISTENCE;  Residency   and Excellency  are forms chiefly used in special  senses while the -ce forms do the general work; and under  COM- PLACENCY  the -cy form is recom- mended for differentiation not from complacence,  but from  complaisance.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

"centenary,",,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
" centennial,","nn.  meaning hundredth  anniversary.  Centenary,  the usual British form, has the disadvan- tage  that  the notion of years is not, except  by modern development, con- tained in  it;  this, however, is  true  also of  century,  and  need not count for much.  Centennial,  chiefly  used  (as  a noun) in America, has the disadvantage that  it  gives  a  less  convenient  pattern for  forming the names of higher anni- versaries  on.  That  these are sometimes wanted is a reason for maintaining centenary. The shots made at these higher names often result in monstrosities. Of these bicentenary,  which might have been ducenary,  and  tercentenary  (trecenary), must be taken as established;  quater- centenary  and  quincentenary  have put in an appearance, and are unlikely to be ousted by  quadringenary  and  quin- genary.  Nor is anyone, however pas- sionate a supporter of etymological correctness, likely to try to introduce sescenary,  septingenary, octingenary,  or nongenary  ;  ANALOGY  will insist on  cent coming into the word somehow;  sex- centenary  and  octingentenary  have al- ready  been used.

chiropodist,"drawn is so familiar  that  childish  is in some danger of being restricted to the depreciatory use  that  is  only  one of its functions,  while  childlike  is applied outside its sphere. The face, for in- stance,  that  we like a  child  to have should be called not a childlike, but a childish  face; the rule  that  childish  has a  bad sense is too sweeping, and mis- leads.  Childish  used of adults or their qualities,  and  childlike  (which should always  be so used), have the opposite implications of blame and approval. Childish  means  'that  ought to have outgrown something or to have been outgrown', and  childlike  'that  has for- tunately not outgrown something or been  outgrown*.  Childish simplicity  in an  adult is a fault;  childlike  simplicity  is a merit; but  childish  simplicity  may mean also  simplicity in (and not as of) a child, and convey no blame.

"cinema, cinematograph, kin-.","The cin-  forms are obviously more handy for  words in constant popular use, and we were right to accept  them  heartily.

(1)  English  c  for Greek  k 3 far  from being wrong, is normal; cf. catholic,  cenotaph,  Circe,  colon,  cubic, cycle.  It may be regrettable  that, since  the scientific words  kinetic and  kinematic  are abnormally spelt, the connexion of  cinematograph  with them  is obscured; but  that  is their fault, not its. (2) The vowel sounds and the syllable accents will be found justi- fied  in the  article  FALSE  QUANTITY.  The chief  objection—to  misplacing in  sV- nëma  the stress of the Greek  kïnê'ma — falls  to the ground when it is remem- bered  that  cinema  is not the Greek word  kinema  at all, but a curtailed form of  cinematograph,  whose second  syllable is  bound to be  -ne-  in popular speech.

A few obvious specimens are  durance vile,  filthy  lucre,  sleep  the  sleep  of the just,  tender  mercies,  own  the  soft  impeach- ment, suffer a sea  change,  leave no  stone unturned.  There are others  that  may or may  not deserve to be classed  with them;  that  depends on whether they are  used mechanically, taken off the peg as convenient reach-me-downs, or are  chosen deliberately as the fittest way  of  saying  what needs to be said. To take one or two examples from the many hundreds of words and phrases that  it is now fashionable to brand as clichés,  writers would be needlessly handicapped if they were never allowed to say  that  something was a  foregone conclusion,  or  Hobson's  choice,  or a  white elephant,  or  that  someone was  feather- ing  his nest  or  had his  tongue  in his  cheek or  a bee in his bonnet.  What  is new is not necessarily  better  than what is old; the original felicity  that  has made a phrase a  cliché  may not be beyond recapture. The enthusiasm of the cliché-hunters  is apt to run away with  them.  The professional writer of today is  less  in need of being warned against  using  clichés  than  of  being reminded of the advice once given by J.  A. Spender : 'The hardest worked  cliché  is  better  than the phrase  that  fails.  ... Journalese results from the efforts of the non-literary mind to discover alternatives for the obvious where none are necessary, and it is best avoided  by the frank acceptance of even a hard-worn phrase when it expresses what you want to say.' Or, to quote  Clutton  Brock : 'A writer may of course attain to a fami- liar  metaphor in his own process of expres- sion,  but if he does, if it is exactly what he has  to  say,  then  it will not seem stale to the reader. ... If an image forces itself upon a  writer because it and it alone will express his  meaning,  then  it is his image, no  matter how often it has been used before.'

climacteric,"prefabricated phrase. They are readily recognizable,  and present themselves without  disguise for deliberate adop- tion or deliberate rejection. More insidious  are those apparently in- nocent phrases  that,  almost  unnoticed, are  on the way to becoming  clichés. They  slip past the barrier  without scrutiny. Thus (to take a few ex- amples of the many  that  might be given)  a writer may say  'CLIMATE of  opinion'  without  asking himself whether he means anything more than 'opinion',  or 'within the  FRAMEWORK of  instead of a  bare  preposition, or that  something is 'grinding to a halt' which  is doing no more than slowly stopping; or he may find  that  'in this day  and age' has  thrust  aside the plain word 'today', which was all  that he needed, or  that  'in the ultimate analysis'  has done the same to 'in the end'. Clichés  are plentiful in the  linguis- tic currency of politics, domestic and international.  They  too,  however happy in their original application, soon  lose any semantic value they may   once have had, and become almost wholly emotive.  That,  for instance,  has been the fate of  self- determination,  appeasement,  power  poli- tics,  parity of  esteem,  underprivileged classes,  victimization,  and innumerable others, including  democracy  itself, the classic  example of a  Humpty-Dumpty word. Even  those  admirable recent coinages  cold  war, iron curtain,  peaceful coexistence,  and  wind of  change  are now so  near to  clichés  as to offer  them- selves  as substitutes for thought.

It has produced a  CLICHÉ,  climate of  opinion,  so popular as to encourage the hope  that  it will soon be worked to death. Anyone  tempted  to use it would be wise to ask himself whether opinion  by itself would not do just as well,  as it certainly would in this typical example :  It may  look  as if the c. of o. in the House had hardened against  going  into the  Common  Market.

 war.,"This expression, happily invented  by Walter Lippman in  1947 to describe the relations  then  existing between the United States of America and the Soviet Union, has,  with  all its merits,  two  disadvantages. One is  that it is becoming a  CLICHÉ,  and so, like all clichés,  tending to bemuse thought. The other is  that  the metaphor places politicians in a dilemma when they try to follow it up.  Are  they to advocate a rise  or a  fall  in the  temperature  of the cold war  ?  The latter would  seem  to in- tensify  an already alarming  crisis;  the former to bring the hot war a stage nearer. This problem has to be dodged by doing violence to the metaphor.

collectives.,"The word is applied to many different things.  What  is com- mon to all is  that  a noun singular in form is used  with  a plural implication. For  instance  flock  (a number of sheep or parishioners) is one kind of collec- tive, and  flock  (woollen waste) is an- other.  The first may be treated as singular  or plural  (His  f. was attacked by wolves; His f. was without a pastor or  were  unanimous  in  disapproval),  and can  itself be given a plural form  with the ordinary difference in meaning from the singular  {shepherds  tending their  flocks).  The other  flock  (woollen waste) can be used in either the singu- lar  form  (with  a singular verb) or the plural  (with  a plural verb)  without  any difference of meaning  (A  mattress of flock  or  flocks;  the  flock  has, the flocks have,  not been disinfected).  But the word  collective  is applied to  both,  as well as to many equally dissimilar kinds of noun.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 6.,"2.  Nouns  that  make no plural form but are used as  both  singular and plural, e.g.  counsel  (= barrister),  deer, grouse,  salmon,  sheep,  trout,  or, in a  few  cases,  as plural only, e.g. cattle. 3.  Nouns  that  make plural forms in the normal way but whose singular form may also be used as a plural, sometimes  with  little if any difference of  meaning, e.g.  cannon,  duck,  fish,  but more often  with  some special implica- tion. For instance  hair, straw,  and timber  are used for the mass,  hairs, straws,  and  timbers  for the  particular; chicken,  lamb,  cabbage,  and  potato  are on the dinner table,  chickens, lambs, cabbages,  and  potatoes  are in their natural state;  shot  and  game  are for the pellets and their objectives,  shots  and games  for those words in their  other senses;  elephant  and  lion  are in the bush,  elephants  and  lions  in the zoo; fruit  is the  current  word  and  fruits  the archaic. 4.  Names of  materials  used for a collection of things made from  them, e.g.  china, linen, silver. 5.  Words of  number  or amount  that when used after definite or indefinite numerals have the singular instead of the plural form  (six  brace  of  grouse;  a few  hundredweight  of  coal);  and so  with dozen,  score,  hundred,  and occasionally with  fathom  and  pound. 6.

A  comic actor  is  merely  one who  acts comedy; a  comical actor,  one who  makes  the audience laugh.  Comic  hesitation  is  that in which  the  hesitator  is  playing  the comedian;  comical hesitation,  that  in which observers find comedy,  whether the hesitator meant  them  to or  was  un- conscious  of  them.

 truism.,"All  these  words are often used as terms of reproach in describing the  statements made by a speaker or writer;  but none of  them  is identical in sense  with  any  other,  and if they are not to be misused a rough idea at least of  the distinctions is necessary. It is something to remember  that  no one should welcome  platitude, triviality,  or truism  in the strict sense, as a descrip- tion of a statement of his own, whereas it may be a merit in a statement to be a commonplace  or a  truism  in its loose sense. A  commonplace  is a thing  that,  whether true  or  false,  is so regularly said on certain occasions  that  the repeater of it can  expect  no credit for originality; but the commonplace may be useful. It was formerly used in the sense of a notable  saying,  without  any implica- tion of triteness. Hence the  Common- place  Book  for recording such  sayings. A  platitude  is a thing the stating of which as though it were enlightening or weighty convicts the speaker of dullness;  a platitude is never valuable. The word is misused in:  It is a p. that the lack of  cottages  is one of the chief  of the  motive  forces  which drive the peasantry  to the towns.

 1.,"As a  term  of  gram- mar  c.  means  that  which  completes,  or helps  to  complete,  the  verb, making with  it the  predicate. This  (A) is the widest sense  of  the word,  not  excluding e.g.  the  direct object  of a  transitive verb,  or  adverbs.  It  is possibly  the  most reasonable  application  of the  term;  it is  also  the  least useful,  and the  least used.  (B)  Often  the  direct object  is excluded,  but all  other modifications or appendages  of the  verb  are  called complements  ;  a  sense  found convenient in  schemes  of  sentence  analysis,  but too wide  to be  precise  and too  narrow to  be  logical.  (C) A  further restriction admits only such words  or  phrases  as are  so  essential  to the  verb  that  they form  one  notion  with  it and its  mean- ing  would  be  incomplete  without  them  ; thus  in  He put his  affairs  in  order  the verb  put  is essentially incomplete  with- out  its  complement  in  order,  whereas in  He  replaced  the  volumes  in  order  a new detail merely  is  added  by the adverb  in  order  to the  complete verb replaced;  some verbs  are in  their nature incomplete, e.g.  the  auxiliaries, and,  in must go, go  is the  complement  of  must .

(D)  Lastly, in  the  narrowest sense,  c.  is  applied only  to the  noun  or  adjective predi- cated  by  means  of a  copulative verb (be,  become,  etc.) or of a  factitive verb (make, call, think,  etc.) of the  subject (He  is a  fool;  He  grew  wiser;  He was n",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The average writer is not so degraded as to choose it for its own sake, but he has not realized  that  when  i. c. w.  presents itself to him it is a  sign  that  laziness is mastering his style, or haziness his ideas.

Choice between the two is therefore open when the same sense can be got at from two directions ;  We  hope  for a -ance  of your favours  means  that  we hope they will continue;  We  hope  for a -ation of them  means  that  we hope you will continue  them;  and these amount to the same thing.

I. The  original accent (Jkôntrâf'ï)  lingers  (i)  with  the un- educated  in all  ordinary uses  of the adjective  (not,  perhaps,  in  the  c.)\ (2)  with  most speakers  in the  jocose or childish  c.  for  perverse  or  peevish {Mary,  Mary, quite contrary),  and in contrariness,  -ly,  used  similarly;  (3) with  many speakers  in  contrariwise, especially  when  it  either represents  on the  c.  rather than  in the c.  manner,  or is  used playfully. 2.  On  the  c,  on  the other hand.  The idiomatic sense  of  o. t. 0. h.  is  quite clear;  except  by  misuse (see below)  it never  means  far from  that,  i.e.  it  never introduces something  that  conflicts with  the  truth  of  what  has  preceded, but always  a  coexistent  truth  in con- trast  with  it. The  following  two ex- amples should have  o. t. c.  instead of  o.  t. 0. h.: It  cannot be pleaded that the detail  is  negligible;  it is, o. t. 0. h., of  the  greatest  importance.  /  The  object is  not to  nourish  10,000  cats  by  public charity;  it is, 0. t. 0. h.,  to  put  them  to sleep  in  the lethal  chamber.  An  example of  the right use is :  Food  was abundant; water,  o. t. 0. h.,  was running short. The use  of  0.  t.  c.  is  less  simple  ;  it  may have either  of  the senses  of  which  o.  t. 0.  h.  has  only one;  i.e. it  may mean either  on the other  hand  or  far  from  that', but  if it  stands first  in its  sentence  it can  only mean  far  from  that.  Thus Food  was abundant;  0. t. c,  water was running  short  is  impossible;  but  Food was abundant; water, 0.  t.  c,  was  running short  is not  incorrect, though  o. t.  0.  h. is  commoner and,  with  a  view to  future differentiation, preferable.

But  to  apply  the  opposite  to a  mere con- trary (e.g.  to /  did not hit him  in  relation to  /  hit him,  which has no opposite),  or to  the  converse (e.g.  to  He hit me  in relation  to /  hit him,  to  which  it is neither contrary  nor  opposite),  is a looseness  that  may  easily  result  in  mis- understanding.  The  temptation  to go wrong is intelligible when  it  is remem- bered  that  with  certain types  of  sen- tence  (A  exceeds  B)  the  converse  and the opposite are  identical (B  exceeds  A).",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Another way of forming curtailed words is to combine initial letters, a method  now so popular, especially in America,  that  a  word— acronym —has been  coined  for  it.  The  first world war produced a  few— Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps),  Dora  (Defence of the Realm Act),  Wrens  (Women's Royal Naval Service),  and the second a great many; among  them  Asdic  (Allied Submarine Detection Investigation Committee), Cema  (Council for Encouragement of Music and the Arts, now the Arts Council of  Great  Britain, which is not amenable to this  treatment),  Ensa (Entertainments National Service As- sociation),  Fany  (First Aid Nursing Yeomanry),  Fido  (Fog Investigation Dispersal  Operation),  Naafi  (Navy Army and Air Force Institutes),  Octu (Officer Cadet Training Unit),  Pluto (Pipe  Line under the Ocean),  Radar (Radio Detection and  Ranging),  Rente (Royal  Mechanical and Electrical En- gineers),  S7zae/(Supreme  Headquarters",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
curts(e)y,"Allied  Expeditionary Force),  Wracs (Women's Royal Army Corps), and Wrafs  (Women's Royal Air Force). The process has since continued: the United Nations Organization itself is Uno  and some of its branches have lent themselves to this form of abbrevia- tion, e.g.  Unrra  and  Unesco.  The Western Alliance has given us  Gatt (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade),  Nato  (North  Atlantic Treaty Organization),  and  Shape  (Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Powers in Europe);  the initials of the organiza- tion most frequently referred to and with  the most cumbrous  title  (The Organization for European Economic Cooperation) are unfortunately un- pronounceable. But European econo- mic cooperation on a smaller scale has produced  Benelux  (Belgium,  Nether- lands,  Luxembourg), and  Efta  (Euro- pean Free Trade Area). Some of our trade unions admit of this labour- saving  device, e.g.  Aslef  (Association of  Locomotive Engineers and Fire- men),  Natsopa  (National Society of Operative Printers and Assistants) and Nalgo  (National Association of Local Government Officers).  Neddy  for the National  Economic  Development Council and  Nicky  for the National Incomes Commission were irresistible, and we always welcome any oppor- tunity of  giving  pet names of this sort to the new inventions of atomic or electronic science, e.g.  Hector  (Heated Experimental Carbon Thermal Oscil- lator Reactor) and  Ernie  (Electronic Random  Number  Indicating Equip- ment).",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 dis-.,"The function of these prefixes is to form a compound verb with  the sense of undoing the action of the simple one, and they are an  in- valuable element in the language, con- stantly providing us  with  useful new words such as (to take one or two recent examples)  debunk, debus, de-ice, degauss,  demob,  and  derate.  But the device should be used  with  discrimina- tion; it is dangerously  easy  for a writer to invent a new word of this kind to save  himself the trouble of thinking of an  existing antonym.  'At  the present rate of distortion of our language', it has  been said,  'it  looks as if we should soon  be talking about  black  and  dis- black,  good  and  disgood.' There are, however, two reasons for coining  a  de-  or  dis-  word  that  cannot be ascribed to indolence. One is where the action to be undone is expressed by a  word used in a special sense  that would not be conveyed by any existing antonym; this justification can be pleaded for inventing, e.g.,  derequisi- tion,  decontaminate,  derestrict,  rather than using such words as  restore, cleanse,  and  free.  Even on behalf of so unprepossessing  a word as  desegrega- tion {The line of absolute  resistance  to desegregation  of the  schools  in Virginia has  suddenly  crumbled)  it can be argued that  only  with  its help could the writer make his meaning immediately clear without  circumlocution. The other good reason for such coin- ages  is to provide words of inter- mediate meaning, as we have long had dispraise  for something between  praise and  blame,  and  disharmony  for some- thing between  harmony  and  discord. Thus economists, who are specially given  to these experiments, have in- vented  disincentive, disinflation, dis- economy,  and  dissaving  as words  with meanings  less  positive than the anto- nyms  deterrent,  deflation,  extravagance, and  spending.  These words have not had a universal welcome, but no one can  deny  that  they spring from a laud- able desire to make language more precise.

"decided,",,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 decisive.,"Decisive  is  often used loosely where  decided  is the right word, just as  DEFINITIVE  is a common blunder for  definite,  and  DISTINCTIVE an  occasional one for  distinct.  A  decided victory or superiority is one the reality of  which is unquestionable ; a  decisive one is one  that  decides or goes far towards deciding some issue ; a  decided person is one who knows his own mind, and a  decided  manner  that  which comes of  such knowledge; a  decisive  person, so  far as the phrase is permissible at all,  is one who has a way of getting his policy  or purpose carried through. The two meanings are quite separate; but, as  the  decided  tends to be  decisive  also, it gets called so even when decisiveness is  irrelevant. Examples of the wrong use are:  The Serjeant, a decisive man, ordered  . .  . /  A  decisive  leaning  tozvards what is most simple.  /  It  zvas  not an age of  decisive  thought.  /  Poe is  decisively  the first  of  American  poets.  The following suggests  a further confusion  with  in- cisive:  The  Neue  Freie Presse  makes some  very decisive remarks about the Italian  operations  at  Preveza.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
decimate,"meant  originally  to kill every  tenth  man as a punishment for cowardice or mutiny. Its application is  naturally extended to the destruction in any way of a large proportion of anything reckoned by number, e.g. a population may be said to be decim- ated  by'a  plague. But undue advantage is  taken of this latitude by a journalist who applies the word to the virtual extermination of rabbits by  myxoma- tosis;  and anything  that  is expressly inconsistent  with  the proper sense  (A single  frosty night  decimated  the  currants by as much as  8o o/ o )  must be avoided. A startling example of  what  this may lead  to was given by a contributor to correspondence in  The Times  on the misuse  of the word  LITERALLY.

 deficient.,"The differentia- tion tends  to  become complete,  defec- tive  being associated more  and  more with  defect,  and  deficient  with  deficit. That  is  deficient  of  which  there  is either  not  enough  or  none,  that  is defective which  has  something faulty about  it; so  deficient quantity, revenue, warmth, means', defective quality, con- dition, sight,  pronunciation,  boots',  a  de- fective  chimney, valve, manuscript,  hat. With  some words quantity and quality come  to the  same thing;  for  instance, much  or  great  insight  is the  same  as deep  or  penetrating  insight;  consequent- ly  a  person's insight may  be  described either  as  defective  or  deficient.  Again, deficiency  in or of a  part  constitutes a  defect  in  the whole ;  thus  milk may be defective  because  it is  deficient  in  fatty matter.  Lastly, either word may some- times  be  used,  but  with  a  difference of  meaning  from  the  other;  deficient water  or  light  is too  little water  or light;  but  defective water  is  impure and   defective light  is  uncertain; similarly,  a  defective  differs from  a deficient  supply  in  being irregular  or unreliable rather than insufficient  in the aggregate. This useful distinction was blurred  in the old  Mental Defi- ciency  Acts which, though bearing that  title, dealt  with  persons  termed mental  defectives.  But  both  expressions have now been abolished  as  statutory terms;  mental deficiency  has  become subnormality  and is  included,  with mental illness,  in the  generic  term, mental disorder.

 1.,"Confusion be- tween  the  two,  and  especially  the use of  definitive  for  definite,  is  very com- mon. Many writers seem  to  think the words mean  the  same,  but the  longer and  less  usual will  be  more imposing, and mistakes are made  easy  by the fact",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
definite,"that  many nouns can be qualified by either, though  with  different effects. Putting aside exceptional senses  that have nothing to do  with  the confusion (as  when  definitive  means of the defin- ing  kind),  definite  means  denned,  clear, precise, unmistakable, etc., and  defini- tive  means having the character of finality. Or, to distinguish  them  by their opposites,  that  is  definite  which is not  dubious,  vague, loose, inexact, un- certain, undefined, or questionable; and  that  is  definitive  which is not temporary, provisional, debatable, or alterable.  A definite offer  is  one  of which the terms are clear;  a definitive offer  is one  that  must  be  taken  or left without  haggling.  Definite jurisdiction is  that  of which the scope or the powers are precisely laid down, and definitive  jurisdiction  is  that  from which there  is no appeal; either  word  can be applied,  with  similar distinctions, to answer,  terms, treaty, renunciation, statement, result,  etc. But  with  many words to which  definite  is rightly and commonly applied (a  definite pain, accusation,  structure, outline, forecast) definitive  either is not used  except  by mistake for  definite,  or  gives  a meaning rarely  required (e.g.  a  definitive  forecast means, if anything, one  that  its  maker announces his intention of abiding by). The  following  examples show wrong uses  of  definitive  :  We should be glad to see  more  definitive teaching.  /  The Bill has not yet been  drazon  up, and the Government  are not  responsible  for forecasts',  however definitively they may be written.  /  The definitive qualities of  jurisprudence  have not often found so agreeable  an exponent as the author of these  essays. 2.  Definite  and  definitely  are over- worked  words.  In  the  nineteen-twenties young people  (and  some older ones) for- got the word  yes:  an affirmative reply was always  definitely  and a negative one usually  definitely not.  That  fashion has waned, but the words have still a habit of  intruding where they are not wanted.

 illusion.,"It  cannot  be  said that  the  words  are  never interchange- able;  it is  significant  of  their nearness in  meaning  that  illusion  has no  verb in  common  use  corresponding  to  de- lude {illude  having almost died  out), and  delusion  has  none corresponding to  disillusion  {undeceive  and  disillusion being  used according  as the  delusion has  been  due to  deceit practised  on the victim  or to his own  error). Nevertheless,  in  any given  context  one is  usually  better  than  the  other;  two distinctions  are  here offered: 1.  A d. is a  belief  that,  though  false, has  been surrendered  to and  accepted by  the  whole mind as  the  truth,  and  so may  be  expected  to  influence action. An  i. is an  impression  that,  though false,  is  entertained provisionally  on the recommendation  of the  senses  or the imagination,  but  awaits full accep- tance  and  may  be  expected  not to in- fluence action.  We  labour under  dd., but indulge  in ii. The dd. of  lunacy, the  ii. of  childhood  or of  enthusiasm. Delusive  hopes result  in  misguided action, illusive hopes merely  in dis- appointment.  That  the sun  moves round  the  earth was once  ad.,  and is still  an i. The  theatre spectator,  the looker  at a  picture  or a  mirror,  ex- perience  i.; if  they lose consciousness of  the  actual facts entirely,  the i. is complete;  if the  spectator throws  his stick  at the  villain,  or the dog  flies  at his  image,  i. has  passed into  d. 2.  The  existing thing  that  deludes  is ad.;  the  thing  falsely  supposed  to  exist, or  the  sum  of the  qualities  with  which an  existing thing  is  falsely  invested,  is an  i.  Optimism  (if  unjustified)  is a d.; Heaven  is (if  non-existent)  an i. If a bachelor dreams  that  he is  married, his marriage  is an i.; if he  marries  in the belief  that  marriage must bring happi- ness,  he  may find  that  marriage  is a d. A mirage,  or the  taking  of it for a  lake, is  a d. ; the  lake  is an i.  What  a  conjuror actually  does—his  real  action—is  ad.; what  he  seems  to do is an i.; the  belief that  he  does what  he  seems  to do is a d.

 etc.,"For  pronunciation see  GREEK  G. demand.  We d.  something  of  or from a  person;  we  make  a  d.  on  him. demean. There  are two  verbs.  One, which  is  always reflexive, means  to conduct oneself  or  behave, and  is  con- nected  with  demeanour  and  derived from  old  French  démener  {He  demeans himself  like  a  king).  The  other, which is  usually  but not  always reflexive  (/ would  not  d.  myself to speak  to  him;  A chair  which  it  would not  d.  his dignity  to fill),  means  to  lower  or  debase. This seems  to be the  product  of a  confusion between  the  first verb and the adjective mean,  and,  though  it is  occasionally found  as a  normal word  in  good authors,  it is  commonest  on the  lips of  the  uneducated  or in  imitations  of them,  and is  best avoided  except  in such contexts.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

derisory.,"The OED definitions (dated 1894)  make no distinction between this and  derisive,  being almost  in the  same words  for  both.  About  the  meaning  of derisive  (conveying derision, deriding) there  is no  doubt  ;  and  if  derisory  means precisely  the  same  it may  well  be re- garded  as a  NEEDLESS  VARIANT,  so  clearly is  derisive  now in  possession.  But, by  the  sort  of  differentiation seen  in MASTERFUL  and  masterly,  a  distinct sense  has been given  to  derisory  ; it  was recognized  by the  OED Supp.  and is now common.  As  derisive  meanr  con- veying  derision,  so  derisory  means  in- viting  or  worthy only  of  derision,  too insignificant  or  futile  for  serious  con- sideration;  it  is applied  to  offers, plans, suggestions,  etc. As Larousse illustrates the use  of  dérisoire  by  'proposition  dé- risoire',  the  new sense may be  a  GALLI- CISM,  but it  would  be a  natural enough development  in  English,  the  word being  no  longer needed  in the  sense now nearly monopolized  by  derisive.

A better  escape  is to use  resolutely,  firmly, with determination,  or  some  other  sub- stitute.

"devil,","n.  Devil's  advocate  is very dangerous  to those who like a pic- turesque phrase but dislike the trouble of  ascertaining its  sense.  Often it is taken to mean a  tempter,  and in the following  example the not unnatural blunder is made of supposing  that  it means  a  whitewashes  or one who pleads  for a person who either is or is supposed to be wicked:  Because  the d.'s a. always starts with the advantage of  possessing  a bad  case,  Talleyrand's defender  calls  forth  all our chivalrous sympathy.  The real  d.'s  a.,  on the con- trary, is one who, when the right of a person to canonization as a saint is being  examined,  puts  the devil's claim to the ownership of him by collecting and  presenting all the  sins  that  he has ever  committed; far from being the whitewasher of the wicked, the d.'s a. is  the blackener of the good. And in this other example the writer referred to is in fact devil's advocate in  'the  rest of  his book', and something quite dif- ferent ('God's advocate', say) in 'an early  chapter':  He  tries  in an early chapter  to act as  'devil's  advocate' for the  Soviet  Government, and  succeeds  in putting  up a  plausible  case  for  the  present régime.

didacticism.,"'No mortal but is nar- row enough to delight in educating others into counterparts of himself; the statement is from  Wilhelm Meister. Men, especially, are as much possessed by  the didactic impulse as women by the maternal instinct. Some of  them work it  orTtf*  officio  upon their children or pupils or parishioners or legislative colleagues,  if they are blest  with  any  of these; others  are  reduced to seizing casual  opportunities, and practise upon their associates or upon the world, if  they can, in speech or  print.  The speaker who has discovered  that Juan  and   Quixote  are not  pro- nounced in Spain as he used to pronounce  them  as a boy is not con- tent  to keep so important a piece of information to himself; he must have the rest of us call  them  Hzvan  and Këhôtâ',  at any rate he will  give  us the chance of mending our ignorant ways by  doing so. The orientalist whom histories  have made familiar  with  the Khalîf  is determined to cure us of the delusion,  implanted in our childish minds by hours  with  some bowdler- ized  Arabian Nights,  that  there  was ever such a being as our old friend the Caliph. Literary critics saddened by our hazy notions of French do their best to improve  them  by using  actual and  sympathetic  as though  their meanings  were the same as those of  actuel  and  sympathique  (see GAL- LICISMS).  Dictionary devotees whose devotion extends to the etymologies think it bad for the rest of us to be connecting  amuck  with  muck,  and come to our rescue  with  amok.  These and many more, in each of their teach- ings,  teach us one  truth  that  we could do as well  without,  and two falsehoods that  are of some importance. The one truth  is, for instance,  that  Khalîf  has a  greater resemblance to Arabic than Caliph  and  Këhôtâ  to the way Cer- vantes spoke than  Kwiksot.  Is  that  of use to anyone who does not know it already?  The two falsehoods are, the first  that  English  is not entitled to  give what form it chooses to foreign words that  it has occasion to use; and the second  that  it is  better  to have two or more forms coexistent than to talk of one thing by one name  that  all can understand. If the first is not  false,  why do we say  Germany  and  Athens  and Brussels  and   Florence   instead of",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
differ,"Deutschland  and  the  rest,  or  allow  the French  to  insult  us  with  Londres  and Angleterre?  That  the second is  false  not even  our  teachers would deny; they would explain instead  that  their aim  is to drive out  the  old wrong form  with  the new right one.  That  they are most  un- likely  to  accomplish, while they  are quite sure  to  produce confusion  tem- porary  or  permanent;  see  MAHOMET for  a  typical  case. Seriously,  our  learned persons  and possessors  of  special  information should not, when they  are  writing  for or speaking  to the  general public,  pre- sume  to  improve  the  accepted vocabu- lary  or  pronunciation.  When  they are   addressing audiences  of  their likes,  they  may  naturally  use, to their heart's content,  the  forms  that are  most familiar  to  both  parties;  but otherwise they should  be at  pains  to translate technical terms into  English. And, what  is of  far greater importance, when they  do  forget this duty,  we others  who are  unlearned,  and  natur- ally  speak  not in  technical terms  but in  English,  should refuse  to be  either cowed  by the  fear  of  seeming ignorant, or  tempted  by the  hope  of  passing  for specialists,  into following their  bad example  without  their real though  in- sufficient  excuse.

To  is  'found  in  writers of  all  ages'  (OED),  and the  prin- ciple  on  which  it is  rejected  (You do not say  differ  to;  therefore  you  cannot say  d. to)  involves  a  hasty  and ill- defined generalization.  Is it  all deriva- tives,  or  derivative adjectives,  or  adjec- tives  that  were once participles,  or actual participles,  that  must conform to  the  construction  of  their parent verbs?  It is  true  of the  last only;  we cannot say  differing  to,  but  that  leaves d.  out in the  cold.  If it is all  deriva- tives,  why do we  say  according,  agree- ably,  and  pursuant,  to  instructions,  when we have  to say  this  accords  with,  or agrees  with,  or  pursues,  instructions? If  derivative adjectives, why  derogatory to,  inconceivable  to,  in  contrast  with derogates  frotn,  not to be  conceived  by? If  ex-participle adjectives,  why do pleases,  suffices,  neglects,  me  go  each its  own way, and  yield  pleasant  to, sufficient  for,  and  negligent  of, me? The fact  is  that  the  objections  to d. to,  like those  to  AVERSE  to,  SYM- PATHY  for,   and   COMPARE   to,   are mere pedantries. This does  not  imply that  d.from  is  wrong;  on the  contrary, it  is  'now  usual' (OED)  ; but it is  only so  owing  to the  dead  set  made against d.  to  by mistaken critics.  For  Different than  see  THAN  8. 2.  Different  has  a  prominent place  in the jargon  of  advertisers. Every  day we hear  or  read  the  slogan  that  so-and- so's  cigarettes, soap, beer, chocolates, etc.  are  'different'.  Why do the  adver- tisers  attribute  so  great  a  potency  to this word?  It is not  necessarily  a  virtue to  be  different;  that  depends  on  what one  is  different from,  and how; and this  we are not  told. Perhaps  the appeal of the word is  to  human nature's perpetual craving  for  change.  The OED Supp., refusing  to  this use  of  the word any higher status than  slang,  de- fines it  as 'out of  the ordinary, special, recherché'.  It  must be losing its appeal, for  advertisers are finding  that  it  needs invigorating;  we are now  told  that some  of  their wares  are  super-different, which  is, it  seems, only  one  degree below  FABULOUS.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
differential,"differential  has  various special uses as  both  adjective and noun  in  several branches  of  science.  It  is  also  a  useful adjective  in the  sense  of  relating  to or depending  on a  difference, especially with  reference  to  rates  of  pay.  The expression  differential rates  of  wages, properly used,  is a  compendious way of  saying  that  the  differences  in the rates  are  differential differences,  that is  to  say they depend on differences  in other things, e.g.  the  skill needed  for the job.  Differential rents  are rightly so called;  they depend  on  differences  in the tenants' incomes. But  then  the  rot sets  in.  Differentials,  properly applied as  a  noun  to  these differential differ- ences,  is  increasingly used, under  the influence  of  LOVE  OF  THE LONG  WORD, as  an  imposing synonym  for  differ- ences  of  all sorts. No more than  differ- ence  was meant  for  instance  in  For  a long  time  this  territory  was run under  a paternalist  régime,  but  on  the  principle that,  in  so  far as  political  power  was devolved,  it  was shared by all  three  races on  an equal  basis — the  assumption being that the numerical differential was can- celled  out  by  the differential  of  relative skills.  Perhaps  the rot  might  be stopped  if  everyone were  to  bear  in mind  that  Ophelia  did not say  You must wear your rue with  a  differential, nor did Wordsworth  write  But she is in her  grave,  and  O  the differential to me. differentiation.   In  dealing  with words,  the  term  is  applied  to the process  by  which  two  words  that can  each  be  used  in two  meanings become  appropriated  one  to  one of the meanings  and one  to  the  other.  Among the OED's  i8th-c.  quotations for  spiri- tual  and  spirituous  are  these  two:  It may not  here  be  improper  to  take notice of  a  wise  and  spiritual  saying  of  this young  prince.  /  The  Greeks, who are  a spirituous and wise  people.  The  asso- ciation  of  each  with  wise  assures  us rather startlingly  that  a  change  has taken place  in  the meaning  of  spirituous.

differentiation,"other;  in  other words, differentiation is  complete.  In a  living language such differentiation  is  perpetually acting upon  thousands  of  words. Most differentiations are, when fully estab- lished,  savers  of  confusion  and  aids to brevity and lucidity, though  in the incomplete stage  there  is a  danger  of their actually misleading readers  who have  not  become aware  of  them  when writers  are  already assuming their acceptance.  When  complete they  im- prove the language by making  it a  finer instrument, just  as the  opposite  pro- cess—SLIPSHOD  EXTENSION—blunts  it. Differentiations become complete  not by authoritative pronouncements  or dictionary  fiats,  but  by being gradually adopted  in  speaking and writing;  it is the business  of all who  care  for the language  to do  their  part  towards helping serviceable ones through  the dangerous  incomplete stage  to  that  in which they are of real value.

dilemma,"for  a  compound vowel sound produced by  combining two simple ones. Diph- thongal  sounds  in  English  are f,  û,  oi, and  ou  (as  in  loud).  Some phoneticians, but  not  all, would  add  à  and  5.  It is immaterial whether the sound is repre- sented  by one  letter  or  two;  the  ï  in idol  and the  û  in  duty  are no  less diphthongs than  the  ei  in  eider  and  the ue  in  due.  But  pairs  of  vowels which, though combined,  are  pronounced with  a  simple vowel sound (e.g. head, feet, boot, soup),  are  digraphs  (see below)  not  diphthongs.

Protests used to be common against the use of  do  as an auxiliary  to  have.  Perhaps these were due to resistance to Americanisms, for  in U.S.  Do you have a match? I don't  have a match  are idiomatic where our own idiom requires  Have  you {got) a  match? I  haven't  (got) a match.

Do you have  coffee?  means for  us is it your habit to drink it;  have you  coffee?  means is  there  any to make the drink  with.  Do  when so used is performing its usual function as a colourless  auxiliary in negative and interrogative sentences and as an em- phasizing  auxiliary in affirmative sen- tences.

If the sentence is affirma- tive— People  under  21  do have the  vote  / We do have to pay for  admission —the do  implies  that  the assertion is contrary to expectation, and is analogous to the emphatic use of  Jo  in such sentences as Do  have a drink  /  You do have  some  odd ideas.  But these limitations on the use of  do have  apply only to the present tense;  did have  is as idiomatic as  had  in all  senses of  have  in the past, and con- tains no implication of habit or custom. /  believe,  although I do not have a  copy of  the  speech,  that I am  quoting  correctly is  idiomatic in America but not in England.  /  believed,  although I did not have a  copy  of the  speech,  that I  was quoting  correctly  is idiomatic in  both countries. The American idiom is, however, encroaching on ours (see AMERICANISMS)  and  may prevail. This, says  C. S. Lewis, is regrettable. 'The language  which can  with  the greatest ease  make the finest and most numer- ous distinctions of meaning is the best. ...  It was  better  to have the older English  distinction between ""I haven't got  indigestion"" (I am not suffering from it at the moment) and ""I don't have indigestion""  (I  am  not  a dyspeptic) than to level  both,  as America has now taught most Englishmen to do, under ""I  don't  have"".'

The use of  do, whether by itself or in conjunction with  as, so, it,  zvhich,  etc., instead of a verb of which some  part  has occurred previously,  is a convenient and estab- lished  idiom; but it has often bad results.

 passives.,"The point is sought to  be evaded:  monstrosities of this kind, which are as repulsive to the gram- marian as to the stylist, perhaps  spring by false analogy from the superficially similar  type  seen in  The man was ordered  to be shot.  But the forms from which they are developed are dis- similar:  They ordered the man  to  be shot,  but They seek  to evade  the  point; whereas  man  is one member of the double-barrelled object of  ordered, point  is the object not  of  seek  at all, but of  evade.  It follows  that,  although  man can  be made subject of the passive  was ordered  while its fellow-member is de- ferred,  point  cannot be made subject of  the passive  is sought,  never having been in any sense the object of  seek. To use this clumsy and incorrect construction in  print  amounts to telling the reader  that  he  is not  worth  writing readable English for; a speaker may find  himself  compelled to resort to it because he  must  not stop to recast the sentence he has started on, but writers have no such excuse. Some of the verbs most maltreated in this way are attempt,  begin,  desire,  endeavour,  hope, intend,  propose,  purpose,  seek,  and threaten  (commonest of all perhaps is fear  in such a sentence as  all the passengers  are  feared to have been killed or  feared killed;  so common as to qualify  as  a STURDY INDEFENSIBLE).

"doubletalk,","formerly  applied  in America to a particular kind of jocular nonsense, is now mostly used for a way of  speech  that  deliberately employs words not as symbols but as excitants of  emotion.

By using doubletalk the same thing may be called  either  tyranny  or  democracy, either  aggression  or  liberation,  either rébellion  or   self-determination.   In Orwell's  Nineteen Eighty-four   this language,  called by  him  Newspeak, was an  instrument  of government designed eventually to  produce  double- think,  'the  power  of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's  mind simultaneously and accepting  both'.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In the sense now the worse for  drink,  drunken  is strictly the correct  attributive  adjective and  drunk  the predicative; /  saw a drunken man;  the man I  saw was drunk. But  drunk  is now increasingly used colloquially  as an  attribute,  and even as  a noun.  There  were  a lot of drunk people  (or  drunks) about. Drunken  is, however, still the only admissible form for the meaning given to drink or symptomatic etc. of drunkenness  {A lazy  -en lying  ne'er-do-weel;  His -en habits).  It may be used predicatively also,  but only in the sense  given to drink  (cf.  He was -en and  dissolute  with He was drunk and incapable); He was -en yesterday  is contrary to modern idiom. Drunk  is fertile of synonyms. The formal  inebriated  is now little used, and the formal  intoxicated  only in formal contexts; polite alternatives are  under the influence  and  the  worse  for liquor.

The prepositional use of  owing  to  is some  150  years old, but of a similar use of  due to  there  is not a vestige in  the OED  (1897);  in the  1933 Supp. it is said to be  'frequent  in U.S.  use', and in  1964  the COD tersely dismisses  it as 'incorrect'. The original edition of the present Dictionary said this:  'It  is now as common as can be, though only, if the view taken in this article is correct, among the illiterate; that  term  is here to be taken as includ- ing  all who are unfamiliar  with  good writers, and are consequently unaware of  any idiomatic difference between Owing to his age he was  unable  to com- pete  and  Due to his age he was unable to compete.  Perhaps the illiterates will beat idiom; perhaps idiom will beat the illiterates; our grandsons will know.'  Now, when this usage is still  'as common as can be' and is   freely employed by BBC an- nouncers, it seems clear  that  idiom, though still resisting stoutly, is fight- ing  a losing battle.

1.,"Number  of, and  with,  e. 2.  Each other.  3.  Between e. 1.  Number.  E.  as subject is in- variably  singular, even when followed by  of them  etc. :  E. of the  wheels  has  12 spokes  (not  have).  When  e.  is not the subject,  but in apposition  with  a plural noun or pronoun as subject, the verb (and complement) is invariably plural: The  wheels  have  12  spokes  e. ; the  wheels e.  have  12  spokes  (this latter order is better  avoided);  the wheels are e.  12- spoked.  But the number of a later noun or pronoun, and the correspond- ing  choice of a possessive adjective, depend upon whether  e.  stands before or after the verb, and this  again  de- pends on the distributive emphasis required. If the distribution is not to be formally emphasized,  e.  stands be- fore the verb (or its complement, or some  part  of the phrase composing it), and the plural number and corre- sponding possessive are used:  We e. have our own nostrums  (not  his own nostrum,  nor  our own  nostrum);  They are  e. of  them  masters  in their own  homes. If  the distribution is to be formally insisted  on,  e.  stands after the verb (and complement) and is followed by singular  nouns and the corresponding possessives  :  we are  responsible  e.for his own  vote  (also sometimes, by confusion, e.for  our own  votes,  and sometimes, by double confusion,  e. for our own  vote).

See  also  NUMBER  II. 2.  Each other  is now  treated  as a compound word, the verb or preposi- tion  that  governs  other  standing before e.  instead of in its normal place :  they hate e. o., they sent presents to e. o., are usually preferred to  e. hates the other(s),  they sent presents e. to the other(s).  But the phrase is so far  true  to its origin  that  its possessive is  e. other's (not  others'),  and  that  it cannot be used when  the case of  other  would be sub- jective :  a lot of old cats ready to tear out  e. other's  (not  others') eyes; we e. know what the other wants  (not  what e. o.  wants).  Some writers use  e. o. only  when  no more  than  two things are referred to,  one another  being similarly appropriated to larger numbers; but this differentiation is neither of present utility nor based on historical usage. The old distributive of two as opposed to several was not  e.,  but  either;  and either  other,  which formerly existed beside  e. o.  and  one another,  would doubtless have survived if its special meaning had been required. 3.

-edly.,"An apology is perhaps due for 'setting  out a stramineous subject' at the length this article  must  run to; but some writers certainly need advice on it  (Women and  girls  stayed their needles  while the Liberal leader's wife and daughter chatted  informedly  with them),  and few have  time  for the in- ductive process required, in default of perfect literary instinct, to establish sound rules. Experiments in unfamiliar adverbs of this  type  (as  embarrassedly,  boredly, mystifiedly,  biassedly,  painedly, awedly) lay  the maker open to a double sus- picion:  he may be  NOVELTY-HUNTING (conscious,  that  is, of a dullness  that must  be artificially relieved) or he may be  putting  down the abnormal in the belief  that  it is normal and so betraying that  his literary ear is at fault. The following is offered as a fairly complete list of the standard words; there  are some hundreds of others to which  there  is no objection, but these will suffice to  test  doubtful  forms by. The list is in  three  parts, first adverbs from adjectives in  -ed,  secondly ad- verbs from adjective-noun compounds in  -ed,  and lastly adverbs from  true past participles. It will probably be admitted by everyone  that  the list is made up wholly of words known to be in the language  already and not having to be manufactured for some special occa- sion  with  doubts  about  their right to exist.  Most  readers  will  admit also  that, while it is physically possible to say any  of those starred  without  allowing a  separate syllable to the  -ed-,  the only ones actually so pronounced by edu- cated persons are those  with  two stars ; fixedly,  for instance, demands its  three syllables,  and  unconcernedly  its five. 1.

From  true  past participles (includ- ing  some  with  corresponding negative or positive forms in equally or  less common use, which need not be men- tioned):  abstractedly,  admittedly ,  ad- visedly*,  assuredly*, avowedly*, col- lectedly,  confessedly*,  confoundedly, connectedly,  constrainedly*, consumed' ly*, contentedly, cursedly*, decidedly, dejectedly,  delightedly, deservedly*, de- signedly*,  devotedly, disappointedly, disinterestedly,  disjointedly, dispiritedly, distractedly,  excitedly, fixedly*, guard- edly, heatedly, hurriedly**, jadedly, markedly*, misguidedly, perplexedly*, pointedly,   professedly*,   repeatedly, reputedly,  resignedly*, restrainedly*, rootedly,  statedly,  unabatedly,  un- affectedly,  unconcernedly*, undaunt- edly,  undisguisedly*, undisputedly, undoubtedly,  unexpectedly, unfeign- edly*,  unfoundedly, uninterruptedly, unitedly,  unreservedly*,  unwontedly. The upshot is  that,  among the hundreds of adverbs in  -edly  that  may suggest  themselves as  convenient novelties,  (a) those  that  must  sound the e are unobjectionable, e.g.  ani- matedly,  offendedly,  unstintedly, (b)  of those in which the e can (physically) be either sounded or silent none  (with the exception of those in  classes  (c) and  (d)  below) are tolerable unless the writer is prepared to have the e sounded;  thus  the user of  composedly, confusedly,  dispersedly, pronouncedly, absorbedly,  and  declaredly,  will not resent their being given four syllables each, and they pass the  test  ; but no one will  write  experiencedly, accomplish- edly,  boredly,  skilledly,  or  discouragedly, and consent to the  ed's  being a distinct syllable;  they are therefore ruled out; (c) hurriedly  suggests  that  such forms as  palsiedly, worriedly, variedly,  fren- ziedly,  and  studiedly  (from verbs in unaccented  -y  )  are legitimate ;  (d)  words in unaccented  -ure, -our,  or  -er,  seem",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

This point will be found fully illustrated in  REPE- TITION;  but it may be  shortly  set out here, a kind providence having sent a neatly contrasted pair of quotations: (A)  Dr.  Lebbé  seriously  maintains that in the near future  opium-smoking  will be  as  serious  as the absinthe  scourge  in France;  (B)  The return of the National- ists  to Parliament means that they are prepared  to treat  seriously  any  serious attempt  to get Home Rule into working order.

What has  Bohemia done  that  its females should be mere women? Are owners subject to influences  that  do not affect employers ?

But since the favourite ancient  metre  for such pieces was the elegiacs  so named on  that  account, a natural reaction caused anything  writ- ten in elegiacs to be called an elegy, whatever its subject, and the name was extended  to cover any short poem, irrespective of  metre,  that  was of the subjective kind, i.e. was concerned with  expressing its author's feelings.

Elemental  refers to  'the  elements' either in the old sense of earth,  water, air  and fire, or as representing the great forces of  nature  conceived as their  manifestations (or, metaphori- cally,  the human instincts comparable in  power  to those forces);  elementary refers  to elements  in the more general  sense of simplest  component parts or rudiments.

There would be no- thing revolutionary  about  it ;  we  long ago  took to printing the possessive  -es as 's,  and our conversion of  can not  into a  single word may be significant of a trend  towards  further  telescoping of our negatived auxiliaries. Meanwhile the printing of these elided forms in serious  prose will no  doubt  continue to  grate  on  some  old-fashioned people. They seem to be intended, like  the  VERBLESS  SENTENCE,  to  create a  pleasant sense of intimacy  between writer  and reader. For some readers they may. On others, until we have got used to  them,  they may  obtrude themselves as a gimmick. A friendly conversational atmosphere is an ex- cellent thing, but  digs  in the ribs and slaps  on the back, however well intentioned, are seldom the best way of promoting one.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

When  a passage would, if fully set out, contain two compound members corresponding to each  other,  how far may the whole be shortened by  omit- ting in one of these members  ('under- standing',  in grammatical parlance) a part  that  is either expressed in the other  or  easily  inferable from  what  is there  expressed  ?  Possible varieties are so  numerous  that  it will be  better  not to hazard a general rule, but to say  that the expressed can generally be 'under- stood', and the inferable can be in specially  favourable  circumstances, and  then  proceed to some types in which mistakes are common. 1.  Ellipsis of parts of  be  and  have. Not only the expressed  part  can be understood, but also the corresponding part  with  change of  number  or person: The ringleader was hanged and his fol- lowers  imprisoned; He is dead, and I alive; The years have passed and the appointed  time  come;  Later the bomb was  covered  by the incoming tide and the  disposal  men  forced  to  suspend  work. These are permissible; not all  that  is lawful, however, is expedient, and the licence is not to be recommended out- side  sentences of this simple  pattern. With  the intervening clause in the following quotation it is clearly ill- advised:  A number of  stumbling-blocks have been removed,  and  the  road  along which the measure will have to travel straightened  out;  it should be observed that  it is the distance of  straightened from  have been,  and not the change of number  in the verbs,  that  demands the insertion of  has been. 2.  Ellipsis of second  part  of com- pound  verb. Only the expressed  part can  be understood;  No State can or will adopt  would be regular, but  No State  has or can adopt  is (however com- mon) an elementary blunder. The understanding of an infinitive  with  to out of one  without  to (A standard of public  opinion which ought and we be-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
ellipsis,"lieve  will  strengthen  the  sense  of  parental responsibility)  is  equally common  and equally  wrong;  insert after  ought  either to  strengthen  or  to.  Wrong  too is the understanding  of an  infinitive  be  out of  a  preceding past participle  been  in These  usually  came  from  constituencies which  have never been won  by  Labour and  probably  never will. 3.  Ellipsis  with  change  of  voice. Even  if the  form required  is  identical with  that  elsewhere expressed, the word should be repeated if the voice is  différ- ent,  as  inThough we do not  believe  that the  House  of  Lords would have really revised  the Bill, as no doubt  it  could  be f\with  advantage.  Still  less  can the passive  managed  be  supplied from  the active  manage  in  Mr.  Dennett  foresees  a bright  future  for  Benin  if  our officials will manage matters conformably with its  'customs',  as  they ought  to  have been A.  And  with  these may be classed  the leaving  us to get  to  be  out of the pre- ceding  to  in //  the two lines are to  cross, the  rate  of  loss  A  reduced  to  zero,  and  a definite  increase  in  the world's shipping to  be  brought  about ...   ; or,  even worse, leaving  us to get  be  out of a  preceding go,  as in  He  said the country needed  a national  compact that  restrictive  prac- tices  would go and the strike  weapon  A hung  on the wall. 4.  Omission  of  that  (conjunction). Though this  is  strictly speaking  not an ellipsis,  but  rather  an  exercise  of the ancient right  to  abstain from subordi- nating  a  substantival clause  (And I seyde  his  opinioun  was  good —Chaucer), it may conveniently be mentioned here. Three examples will suffice  to  show the unpleasantness of  ill-advised  omis- sion,  and to  suggest some cautions: Sir, — I  am  abashed  to  see  Ain  my notice  of  Mr. Bradley Bin's  '  ""Sylhet"" Thackeray'  A  /  have  credited  the elder W.  M.  Thackeray  with  sixteen  children.} Mr. Balfour blurted  out  that  his  own view  was  A  the House  of  Lords was  not strong  enough.  / /  assert  A  the  feeling  in Canada today  is  such against annexa- tion  that  . . . The  first illustrates  the principle  that  if  there  is the  least room for  doubt  where  the  that  would come, it should  be  expressed and  not  under- 153",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

ellipsis,"stood.  The  second leads  us to the  rule that,  when  the  contents  of a  clause  are attached  by a  part  of  be  to  such words as  opinion,  decision,  view,  or  declaration (a  very common type),  that  must  be inserted.  At the  same time  it  illustrates the motive  that  most frequently causes wrong  omissions—the  sensible reluc- tance  to  make one  that-clause  depend on  another;  but  this  is  always avoid- able  by other, though often  less  simple, means.  The  third involves  a  matter  of idiom, and reminds us  that,  while some verbs  of  saying  and  thinking  can  take or drop  that  at  will, many have  a  strong preference  for  one  or the  other use (see THAT,  CONJ.  2);  assert  is  among those that  habitually take  that. 5.  Ellipsis  after  than  is  extremely common,  and so  various  in  detail  as to make the laying down of any general rule impossible.  The  comparative claims  of  brevity  on the  one hand, and on the other of the comfort  that  springs from feeling  that  all is shipshape, must in  each case  be  weighed  with  judge- ment.  It  will  be  best  to put  together a  few examples, ranging from the more to  the  less  obvious,  in  which doubts whether  all is  right  with  the  sentence obtrude  themselves.  The  evil  conse- quences  of  excess  of  these  beverages  is much  greater  than  A  alcohol  means than the evil consequences  of  excess  of alcohol  are great. How are  we to  com- press  that?  Shall  we (a)  omit  are great}  Yes, everyone does  it;  (b)  omit the  evil  consequences  of  excess  of}  No, no  one  could  do it but  one who could also  write, like this author,  consequences is;  (c)  retain  all  this?  No—waste  of words;  (d)  shorten  to  those  of  excess  of} Yes,  unless  the  knot  is cut by  writing than with  alcohol.  /  That  export  trade  is advancing  with  greater  rapidity than our trade  has ever increased;  i.e.  than  any rapidity  with  which ours has increased  ; shorten  to  more  rapidly than our trade ever  has.  /  The  proceedings  were  more humiliating to  ourselves  than  I  can  recol- lect  in the  course  of my  political expe- rience;  i.e.  than  I can  recollect  any proceedings  being humiliating ; shorten to  any that  I  can  recollect.  /  The inter- pretations  are  more  uniformly  admirable",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Ellipsis  complicated by  INVERSION. In  questions, and in sentences begin- ning  with  nor  and certain other words, inversion  is normal, the subject stand- ing  after instead of before the auxiliary (Never  did I hear,  not  Never I heard). When  a sentence or clause  thus  in- verted has to be enlarged by a parallel member of the kind in which ellipsis would naturally  be  resorted to, diffi- culties  arise.  Why is a man in civil life perpetually  slandering  and  backbiting  his fellow  men, and is  unable  to  see  good  even in his  friends?  The repetition of  is without  repeating  why  and the subject is  impossible;  in this particular sen- tence the removal of the second  is would solve the problem as well as the re-insertion of  why is he;  but repeti- tion is often the only course possible. Not only may such a  love  have  deepened and exalted, and may still deepen and exalt, the  life  of any man of any age, but. ..  The inversion has to be  carried on;  that  is,  not only,  and the subject placed after  may,  must be repeated if may  is repeated; and,  may  being here indispensable,  nothing  less  will do than  not only  (with  and  omitted)  may it still  deepen. 7.  For ellipsis  of  that  (rel.  pron.), and of  prepositions governing it, see  THAT, REL.  PRON. 3 and 4. else.  The adverb  e.  has come  so  near to being compounded  with  certain in- definite pronouns and words of similar character  (anybody,  everyone,  little, all, etc.)  that  separation is habitually avoided,  and e.g.  Nobody is  ignorant  of it e.  is unidiomatic; correspondingly, the usual possessive form is not  every- one's  etc.  e.,  which is felt to be pedantic though correct, but  everyone  else's. With  interrogative pronouns the pro- cess  has not gone so far. Though  What e.  did he say?  is the normal form,  What did he say e.  ?  is unobjectionable; corre- spondingly,  who  else's  may be used colloquially,  but  whose  else  has main- tained its ground; and of the forms Who  else's  should  it  be?.

With  some the right of the  -en  verb to exist is disputable, and  with  others the un- doubted existence of two verbs (e.g. loo^e  and  loosen),  one being identical with  the adjective and one having  -en, raises  the question of differentiated senses;  and some remarks may be offered on each. The following is the list,  thought to be fairly complete, of the ordinary  -en  verbs, not including anomalous ones like  strengthen,  nor any  whose right to exist is dubious: blacken,  brighten,  broaden, cheapen, coarsen,  darken, deaden, deafen, deepen, fasten,  fatten, flatten,  freshen,  gladden, harden,  harshen,  lessen,  liken, lighten, loosen,  louden,  madden,  moisten,  quicken, redden,  ripen,  roughen,  sadden, sharpen, shorten,  sicken,  slacken,  smarten, soften, steepen,  stiffen, straighten, straiten, sweeten,  tauten, thicken, tighten,  tough- en,  weaken, whiten, widen,  worsen. The debatable words are: black  and  blacken:  the second is the wider word used for most purposes, black  being confined to the sense put black  colour upon, besides being only transitive  except  when used  with  out, meaning to suffer a momentary  loss  of consciousness.

This is now obsolete, so  that  'far from the madding crowd', which is an example of it in Gray's  line 'Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife', is perhaps generally  taken in the mutilated form to which Thomas Hardy  gave  currency to mean far from the distracting crowd. The only present function of  to mad  is to supply a poetical synonym for  mad- den,  which has suffered from wear and tear as a trivial exaggeration for annoy. olden:  this had a vogue during the 19th  c. in the sense make or become older in looks or habits, and was an especial  favourite of Thackeray's ; but, with  to age  well established, it is a SUPERFLUOUS  WORD and  has  rightly fallen  into disuse. quiet  and  quieten  :  quiet  as a verb dates from  1440  at least, and appears in the Prayer  Book, Shakespeare, Burke, and Macaulay,  besides many good minor writers; it is  both  transitive and in- transitive. For  quieten,  perhaps the 160 envisage only  -en  verb from an adjective of more than one syllable, the most authorita- tive name quoted by the OED is Mrs. Gaskell.  Its inflexions  (quietened,  quiet- ening,  etc.) are  ugly,  and it should have been  dismissed  as a  SUPERFLUOUS  WORD instead of being allowed to usurp the place of the older one. The favour now shown to it is perhaps attributable not so  much to a preference  for  it over quiet  as to ignorance  that  quiet  is a verb. right  and  tighten: to  right  is estab- lished,  and  righten  (called 'rare' by the OED, though used occasionally from the  14th  c. on) is a  SUPERFLUOUS  WORD. rough  and  roughen:  both  are in full use,  with  some idiomatic differentia- tion, though often either will do; see ROUGH(EN). slack  and  slacken:  as  rough(eri);  see SLACK(EN). smooth  and  smoothen  : the OED  gives numerous examples of  smoothen,  each of  which, however, makes one wonder afresh  why on earth  (except  sometimes metri  gratia)  the writer did not content himself  with  smooth',  smoothen  had clearly  a vogue in the early  19th  c, but is now a SUPERFLUOUS WORD. stout  and  stouten  :  stout  occurs only in special  senses,  and is archaic;  stouten also  is now rare. white  and  whiten  :  to white  is perhaps only  used in echoes of 'whited sepul- chres'  and of 'as no fuller on earth can white  them'. worsen,  though some writers may shy  at it and reluctantly prefer  deterio- rate  in the intransitive sense, is quoted from  Milton, George Eliot, and others, and is now common and unexception- able.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Many adjectives besides those de- scribed in  1  and 2 are capable in ordi- nary  use, i.e.  without  the stylistic taint illustrated in 5 and 6, of forming a superlative in  -est,  used  with  the  and serving  as an emphatic form simply, while no one would think of making a comparative in  -er  from  them:  in the brutalest,  civilest,  timidest,  cheerfullest, cunningest,  doggedest,  damnablest,  man- ner.  The  termination  s  ""that  most invite this  treatment  are  -ful,  -ing, -able, -ed, and  -id;  on the other hand the very common adjective terminations  -ive, -ic,  and  -ous,  reject it altogether (curiouser  and  curiouser  is a  product  of Wonderland). Though it is hard to draw a clear line between this use and the  next,  the  intent  is different. The words are felt to be only slightly  less normal, and yet appreciably more forcible,  than the forms  with  most; they are superlatives only, and em- phasis  is their object. 5.  As a stylistic device, based on NOVELTY-HUNTING,  and   developing into disagreeable mannerism, it was once the fashion to extend the use of -er  and  -est  to many adjectives nor- mally  taking  more  and  most,  and the reader got pulled up at intervals by beautifuller,  delicater, ancientest,  dili- gentest,  delectablest,  dolefuller, devoted- est,  admirablest,  and the like. The trick served  Carlyle's purpose, but grew tiresome in his imitators and is no longer  popular. The  extreme  form of it is shown in the  next  paragraph. 6. The emotional  -est  without  the. For  In Darkest Africa  it may perhaps be pleaded  that  the  title  was deliber- ately  chosen for its emotional content. But  such a sentence as  Mile  Nau, an actress  of  considerable  technical  skill and a  valuable  power  of  exhibiting  deepest emotion  is so obviously critical and unemotional  that  it shows fully the VULGARIZATION  of a use  that  is appro- priate only to poetic contexts. In so  analytic a mood the critic should have been content  with  deep emotion. If  he had been talking descriptively, he might have gone as far as 'she exhibited the deepest emotion'  ;  but not unless he had been apostrophizing her in verse as  'deepest emotion's Queen', or by whatever lyric phrase emotion (and not analysis)  might have inspired, should he have dared to cut out his  the  and degrade  the idiom sacred to the poets. Not  that  he is a solitary or original sinner;  half the second-rate writers on art and literature seem to think they have found in this now hackneyed de- vice  an  easy  way of exhibiting intense but restrained feeling. Other  examples :  The problem is not one  of Germany alone; many of the other  States which  were  in the Central Alliance are  in worst  plight  for food, so far as can be gathered.  / . . .  addressed the  Senate,  declaring  that  widest diver- sity  of  opinion  exists  regarding  the  forma- tion of a League of Nations.  /  An extraordinary  announcement is made tonight,  which is  bound  to stir profound- est interest  among all civilized  peoples, and to mark a really new  epoch  in the story  of  democracy.  /  But Stoddard did not  strike the local note, whereas Sted- man  could tell of Stuyvesant and the ""Dutch  Patrol""  in pleasantest fashion and in  accordance  with the very tone of the  Irving  tradition,  j Mr.  Vanderlip  is, therefore,  in closest  touch  with the affairs  of  international  finance. If  the reader will be good enough to examine these one by one, he will cer- tainly  admit this  much—that  such superlatives are, for  better  or worse, departures from custom, and  that  in each sentence a change from  '   est' to '(a)  very   ' or 'the  most   ' or 'the   est'  would be a  return  to normal  English.  If he will  next  try to judge, from all the specimens taken together,  what  effect is pro- duced by this artifice, it may be hoped, though  less  confidently,  that he will agree  with  the following view. The writers have no sense of congrufty  (see  INCONGRUOUS  VOCABU-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 and -est,"LARY),  and are barbarically adorning contexts of straightforward  business- like  matter  with  ill-judged scraps of  more exalted  feeling;  the impres- sion  on sensitive readers is merely  that of  a queer simulated emotionalism. 7.  Superlative in comparisons of two.  They  were  forced  to give an answer  which was not their real answer but only the nearest to it of two al- ternatives.  This use of  -est  instead of -er  where the persons or things com- pared are no more than two should normally be avoided; the  raison d'être of  the comparative is to compare two things,  and it should be allowed to do its job  without  encroachment by the superlative.  Nearer  should have been used in the example given. But excep- tions  must  be admitted. Use of the comparative instead of the superlative would be pedantry in such phrases as Put  your best  foot  foremost;  May the best  man win; Get the best of both worlds;  and who would wish  thus  to weaken Milton's  Whose God is  strong- est,  thine or mine? 8.

The  characteristic sense  of the  longer adjective  and ad- verb  is  pre-eminence  or the  particular as  opposed  to the  ordinary,  that  of the others being limitation  or the  particu- lar  as opposed  to the  general. There is, however,  a  marked tendency  in the adjectives  for  especial  to  disappear and for  special  to  take  its  place.  It  may  be said  that  special  is now  possible  in all senses,  though  especial  is still  also  pos- sible  or  preferable  in the  senses (a)  ex- ceptional  in  degree,  as  My  especial friend  is  Jones;  He  handles  the  matter with  especial  dexterity  ;  Oxford  architec- ture  receives  especial  attention,  (b)  of  or for  a  particular  person  or  thing speci- fied  by  possessive adjective  or  case,  as For  my  or  Smith's  especial  benefit;  For the  especial  benefit  of  wounded  soldiers. In  the  adverbs  the  encroachments  of the shorter form  are  more limited;  a writer may  sometimes  fall  into  saying The  reinforcements  arrived  at a  specially critical  moment,  where  an  especially would  be  better,  but it is as  little allowable  to say  The  candidates,  spe- cially  those  from Scotland,  showed ability  as it is to say  Candidates must be  especially  prepared  or  An  arbitrator was  especially  appointed.  Two examples follow  of  especially  used where  specially is  clearly meant;  in  both  the  sense  is not  to an  exceptional degree,  but for one purpose and  no  other :  The  founder of  the  movement  will be  especially  inter- viewed  for the ten  o'clock  news,  f  Agree- able  features  of the  book  will  be the illustrations,  including  a  number  of reproductions  of  prints  especially  lent. 2.

It later became a  title  of rank, inter- mediate between  knight  and  gentleman, the right to which is still  denned  by law  in a way  that  to modern ideas is in some respects curious.

The meaning of the Greek words was practically the same,  'true inwardness'  being  perhaps  the nearest equivalent in native  English,  but the second was substituted by later Greek philosophers for the first as used by earlier  ones; similarly in Latin  sub- stantia  was a post-Augustan synonym for  Cicero's  essentia.  It is therefore natural  that  essence  and  substance,  essen- tially)  and  substantially),  should on the one hand be sometimes inter- changeable,  and on the other hand develop, like most synonyms, on diverging  lines  with  differentiations gradually  becoming fixed.

" necessary, requisite.","The words so far agree in  the  sense in which they are all commonest, i.e. 'needed',  that  in perhaps most sen- tences containing one of  them  either of the others could be substituted  without serious  change of meaning. It often does not  matter  whether  we say 'the e.' or 'the  n.'j  or 'the r., qualities are cour- age  and intelligence only'. They have reached the meeting-point, however, from different directions, bringing each its native equipment of varying suitability for various tasks. For in- stance,  in  We can hardly say that  capital is as r. to  production  as land and  labour the least suitable of the  three  has been chosen, the word wanted to  class  the relation of land and labour to produc- tion being the strongest of all, whereas r. is the weakest. If  we call something  e.  we have in mind a whole  that  would not be  what it is to be or is or was if the  part  in question were wanting; the e.  thing  is such  that  the other thing is inconceiv- able  without  it.  E.  is the strongest word of  the three. When  we call  something  n.,  we have in mind the irresistible action of  causal- ity or  logic;  the n. thing is such  that the other cannot but owe its existence to it or result in it.  N.  doubles the parts of  indispensable  and  inevitable. When  we call something r., we have in mind merely an  end  for which means are to be found; the r. thing is  that demanded by the conditions, but need not be the only thing  that  could satisfy their demands, though it is usually understood in  that  sense. The fact  that r. has no negative form corresponding to  une.  and  unn.  is significant of its  less exclusive meaning. For  a trivial illustration or two :  Bails are r., but neither e. nor n., for cricket; not e., for it is cricket  without  them; not n., for their want need not stop the game.  In the taking of an oath, reli- gious  belief is e., but neither n. nor r.; the unbeliever's oath is no oath, but the want of belief need not prevent him from swearing, nor will belief help him to swear.

euphemism,"arises  are three:  (a)  sometimes those who are talking about morals choose to call  them  ethics because the  less  fami- liar  word strikes  them  as more impos- ing;  (è)  there is an impression  that ethics is somehow more  definitely  than morals  disconnected from religion; (c)  the distinction is rather fine between the sense of  ethics  as a prevailing code of  morals,  and morals themselves; but, though fine, it is clear enough. 5.  ethical,  moral.  It is in the nature of  things  that  the dividing line between the adjectives should  be  less  clear than with  the nouns. For, if ethics is the science  of morals, whatever concerns morals  evidently concerns ethics too, and  is as much ethical as moral;  and vice  versa. Nevertheless, we talk of  a moral,  but not  an  ethical,  man,  and we perhaps tend more and more to talk of the  ethical  rather than  the moral basis of  society, education, and so forth. At the same time, since  immoral  is popularly associated  with  sexual im- morality,  unethical  has come into vogue  in U.S. as an adjective for the conduct of the man who is immoral in other ways, especially in violating the accepted code of a profession or business.  In England too we avoid the word  immoral  for the same reason, but should probably say  dishonest,  or, if we do not want to use so harsh a word, unscrupulous.  This may not be  true  for long;  the American use of  unethical  is gaining  currency here. Perhaps  that  is because  the words  right  and  wrong  and good  and  wicked  seem now to be old- fashioned. ethos.  Pronounce  ë'thôs.

FRAGETTE.,"euphemism means (the use of) a mild or vague or periphrastic expres- sion  as a substitute for blunt precision or disagreeable  truth.  The heyday of euphemism in England was the mid- Victorian era, when the dead were  the departed,  or  no  longer  living,  pregnant women were  in an  interesting  condition, novelists  wrote  d   d  for damned and  G — d  for God, bowdlerized edi- tions of Shakespeare and Gibbon were put into the hands of the young and trousers were  nether  garments,  or even, jocosely  but significantly,  unmention- ables  or  inexpressibles.  We are  less mealy-mouthed now, though still more given  to euphemisms than our Conti- nental neighbours ; the notice  Commit no  nuisance  ox  Decency  Forbids  was even in  our own day sometimes used for the injunction put more bluntly in France as  Defense  d'uriner.  But euphemism is  a will-o'-the-wisp for ever eluding pursuit; each new word becomes in turn  as explicit as its predecessors and has  to be replaced. The most notori- ous example of the working of this law is  that  which has given us such a plethora of names for the same thing as  jakes, privy, latrine,  water-closet, w.c,  lavatory, loo,  convenience,  ladies, gents,   toilet,  powder-room,   cloaks, and  so on, endlessly. There are of   course—or   were  before  the publication  of   Lady Chatterley's Lover —some  words,  now a small and  rapidly diminishing number, too tainted by bawdy and ribaldry to be usable, and for these polite  syno- nyms  must be found. But delicacy becomes absurdity when it produces such an anticlimax as is contained in Pathological  tests  suggest  that she had two  blows  on the head, was  strangled  and probably  assaulted.  'It is a pity',  said  a President  of the Probate Divorce and Admiralty Division in  1959,  'that  plain English  is not used about these matters in  divorce proceedings.  When  I say plain  English  I mean  that,  so far as I know, ever since the tablets of stone",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
euphuism,"172 were  translated  into  English in the English  version of the Bible,  adultery has  been  the  word,  not  misconduct  or intimacy  or any  other  paraphrase of it.' In the  present  century  euphemism has  been  employed  less in finding dis- creet  terms  for  what  is indelicate  than as  a  protective  device for governments and as a  token  of a new  approach  to psychological and sociological  prob- lems. Its value is  notorious  in  totali- tarian countries,  where  assassination and aggression can be  made  to look respectable  by calling  them  liquidation and  liberation.  In  Western  democra- cies too use is  made  of the device of giving  things new names in  order  to improve  their  appearance.  Thus  what were  at first called crudely Labour Exchanges and Distressed Areas are now  Employment Exchanges  and  De- velopment Districts:  the  poor  are the lower  income brackets  or the  under- privileged  classes:  poor-law relief is national assistance;  those  who used to be  known  as  backward  and  trouble- some children are now  maladjusted; ladies once  termed  mistresses (itself a  euphemism  for the earlier  concubines and  paramours)  are  unmarried wives; insanity  is now   mental disorder; lunatic asylums are  mental hospitals; criminal lunatics are  Broadmoor pa- tients,  and every  kind  of unpleasant event  that  might  call for action by the  government  is discreetly referred to as an  EMERGENCY.  The  same  de- vice is used to give a new look to an old  occupation.  Thus  charwomen  have become  dailies,  gaolers  prison officers, commercial travellers  sales representa- tives,  and RATCATCHERS  rodent   opera- tors.  Dustmen,  naturally resenting our wounding  habit  of emphasizing  their unlikeness to dukes, are now  refuse collectors  or  street  orderlies;  boarding- houses have been rechristened  guest houses;  many  butchers  call themselves purveyors  of meat  and at least one a meat  technologist;  hairdressers are  ton- sorial  artists  and undertakers  funeral furnishers   or   directors,   or  (U.S.) morticians.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
euphuism.,"The  word  is  often  ignor- eve antly  used for euphemism  with  which it is entirely unconnected. It is named from  Lyly's  Euphues  (i.e. The Man of Parts),  fashionable in and after the 16th  c. as a literary model, and it means affected artificiality of style, indulgence in antithesis and simile and conceits, subtly refined choice of words, precio- sity.  It is, unlike euphemism, a  word which no one but the literary critic is likely  to need. A single example of the common misuse will suffice:  While  a financial euphuism christened  rv  :i way construction  a  'transformation  of  capital', and not an expenditure.

The . . . drawings  are academical in the  worst sense  of the  word;  almost  everyone  of them  deserves  a  gold  medal.  In this sentence the making of the two words into one is undoubtedly wrong; this should only be  done  where  every- body  might be substituted.  That  is never  true  when, as here, things and not persons are meant, nor yet when, as here, a partitive  of  fol- lows;  in either of those  cases  it is agreed  that  the words should  be  kept separate. Unfortunately  there  is not the same agreement on the correspond- ing  rule  that  when  everybody  can  be sub- stituted  everyone  should be so  written. The question cannot be decided for everyone  by itself; the parallel  anyone» no  one,  and  someone  must be taken into account; of these  no one  alone is fixed, and  that  is always two words, owing to the natural tendency to pronounce noone  noon.

In this case recognition of the vanity of genteelism has worked in reverse; the old rude word has been restored and expectorate  (apart from its use in medicine) relegated to the vocabulary of the  POLYSYLLABIC  HUMORIST. Per- haps this is because the practice,  less tolerated now  that  an urge to chew is usually  satisfied  with  gum instead of tobacco, is no longer  thought  to deserve a cloak of gentility.

What is  meant by calling a promise explicit is  first  that  it has  been  put into words and secondly  that  its  import  is plain; what is meant by calling it express is first,  as  before,  that  it has been put into words, and secondly  that  the maker meant it to bind him in the  case  con- templated.

To e. a welcome  is tolerable  because of its obviousness as a  metaphor;  but the extending of a hearty reception, sympathy, congratulations, a hear- ing,  a magnificent send-off, and the like,  should if possible be barred (in America a congregation 'extends a  call' to the reverend gentleman of  its  choice); we have still  give,  accord,  and  bestow  to choose between,  with  offer  and  proffer to  meet  the demand for other shades of  meaning. The following quotation shows an application in which even the notion of friendliness inherent in the metaphor  has disappeared:   Being promptly  deported  by the  German  police, he  appealed to the  Foreign  Office for redress,  but  Lord  Salisbury informed him in a characteristically pointed official  dispatch that he could see no grounds  whatever for taking exception to  the treatment which had been ex- tended  to him. Two points are to be observed in regard  to the above advice: (a) The condemnation does not  touch  such sentences  as  You should e. to me the same  indulgence,  where the metaphor may  be  different, and the meaning 'widen it so as to include me as well as someone else' ; (6) it is not maintained that  e.  has never had the sense of give or accord in native  English—it  had in the  i6th-i8th  centuries—but  only  that the modernism does not descend direct from the native use; having been re- imported after  export  to America, it is now ill at ease in the old country.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Hence the mis- apprehension arises  that  it can always govern  them,  and consequently  that the meaning of excuse belongs to the verb. In  fact  it belongs to the combina- tion between the verb and an object meaning  something  blâmable,  though that  object need not always be ex- pressed; the common phrase  ex- tenuating  circumstances,  for instance, means circumstances extenuating the guilt  of the guilty person.

trinsic,".  Etymologically  the  four  differ only  in the formative suffixes used, and there  is no reason why any of  them might not have acquired the senses of all;  outside  is the fundamental mean- ing.  It will be best to take  them  in pairs. I.  exterior  and  external.  That  is exterior which encloses or is  outer- most, the enclosed or innermost being interior. These opposites are chiefly applied to things of which  there  is a pair, and  with  conscious reference, when one is spoken of, to the  other: the exterior court is one within which is  an interior  court;  the exterior door has  another inside it; exterior and interior lines in strategy are concentric curves one enclosing the  other;  and the exterior surface of a hollow ball, but not of a solid one, is a legitimate phrase. That  is external which is  without  and apart  or whose relations are  with  what is  without  and apart,  that  which is within being internal.  The external world  (situated outside us),  external evidence  (derived from sources other than the thing discussed),  external",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
exterior,"remedies  (applied to the outside of the body),  external debt  and  relations  (hav- ing  a sphere of operation outside the country concerned). In  many phrases either  exterior  or  ex- ternal  may be used, but usually  with some  difference of underlying mean- ing;  e.g. the exterior ear is thought of as  the porch of the interior ear, but the external ear is the ear as seen by the outsider. Again, a building's exterior features and external features are differ- ent things, the former being those of its outside only, and the latter all, whether of outside or inside,  that  can actually  be seen.  Similarly,  with  the nouns,  exterior  has the definite narrow material meaning of the outside, as opposed to the inside of a building or the inner nature of a person, while externals  includes all about a person that  reveals him to us, his acts and habits and manner of speech as well as his  features and clothes. 2.  extraneous  and  extrinsic.  That  is extraneous which is brought in, or comes  or has come in, from  without. A  fly in amber, a bullet in one's chest, are  extraneous bodies;  extraneous  aid, interference,  light, sounds;  extraneous points are questions imported into a discussion  from which they do not naturally  arise. That  is extrinsic which is not an essential  and inherent  part  of some- thing, essential  properties  being in- trinsic.  A florin's intrinsic value is what the metal in it would have fetched before it was coined ; its extrinsic value is  what is added by minting. A per- son's  extrinsic advantages are such things  as wealth and family interest, while his courage and talent are in- trinsic  advantages. It is  worth  notice  that  extrinsic  is now rare,  being little used  except  when a formal  contrary is wanted for the still common  intrinsic. Extraneous  on the other hand exists on its own account; it has no formal contrary,  intraneous being  for practical  purposes  non-exist- ent, and must make shift  with  internal, intrinsic,  indigenous,  domestic,  native,  or whatever else suits the particular con- text.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

"-ey, -ie, -y, in pet names.","(By pet name is meant a name used affection- ately,  familiarly, or jocosely instead of the ordinary one for some person, animal,  or thing.) It would be idle to  attempt  to pre- scribe  the spelling of proper names of this kind. The right to spell one's children's names as one pleases is one of  the  few privileges left to the indivi- dual in the Welfare State. Moreover, the  -ey  etc. terminations seem to be going  out of favour; pet names are being  cut down to monosyllabic  size— Al,  Art, Don, Ern, Ken, Les,  Perce, Reg,  Ron, Sid,  and so on. But an examination of others may  be  not  with- out interest. The most established type of  all  (baby,  daddy,  granny)  has  -y ;  it would  be  a simplification if  -y  could be made universal; but  -ie  is preferred in Scotland  (laddie, lassie, caddie);  the retention of  mute  -e,  giving  -ey (dovey, lovey,  etc.) is more defensible than in the adjectives made  with  -y  (see  -EY AND  -Y IN  ADJECTIVES);  and  generally variety  seems unavoidable. In the list the recommended form stands  first  or alone; the principle has been to recommend plain  -y  wherever usage  is not thought to be overwhelm- ingly  against it; the addition of another ending  in brackets means  that that form is perhaps commoner, but not so much so as to make the recommended one impossible.

 fallacious.,"The meaning of fallacious  is inviting a wrong inference, misleading.  It and  fallacy  are some- times  ignorantly used  as   LONG VARIANTS  of false  and  falsehood.  A falla- cious  report  that the  course  was flooded kept many  people  away.  No  doubt  the report  was misleading, but  that  was because it was  untrue,  not because it contained a fallacy.  Lord  B. states that unemployment  reached  its  greatest  heights under the Labour government in   1931. The repetition of this old fallacy  (false- hood)  cannot be allowed to go un- challenged. A fallacy in logic is 'an argument which violates the laws of correct demonstration. An argument may be fallacious  in  matter  (i.e.  misstate- ment  of facts), in  wording  (i.e. wrong use of words), or in the  pro- cess  of  inference.  Fallacies have, there- fore been classified as: I. Material, II.  Verbal, III.  Logical  or For- mal.'— Encycl.  Brit.  Some types of fallacy  are of frequent enough occur- rence to have earned names  that  have passed  into ordinary speech, and serve as  a short way of announcing to a false reasoner  that  his conscious or uncon- scious  sophistry is  detected.  Such are arguing  in  a  circle,  equivocation,  begging the question  (petitio  principii),  igno- ratio  elenchi, argumentum ad hominem etc.,  non sequitur,  post  hoc  ergo  propter hoc,  false analogy, undistributed middle, all  of which will be found alphabeti- cally  placed in this dictionary.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

What  he  says  is  that  it would be shameful for nobody except servants  to be  excluded—which  is plainly  neither  true  nor his contention. The disaster is due to his  giving  too emphatic a place to a subordinate, though important,  point;  what is shameful  is the servants' exclusion, not the inclusion of anyone or everyone else. 2.  An especially common form of false  emphasis (already touched on in BOTH 2)  is the use of the emphatic word both  (which means one as well as the other, or in one case as well as in the other) in places where  that  full sense is either unnecessary or impossible, in- stead  of  the_  two,  they,  or nothing at all. The point is clear if the two sentences (a)  Both fought  well,  and  (b)  To settle the  matter both fought,  are compared. In  (a)  emphasis is wanted; not only one fought well, the other did too; but in  (b)  of course one did not fight with- out the other's fighting, since it takes two to make a fight; the needless  both makes the reader wonder whom else they  both  fought. Obvious as the mis- take is, it is surprising how often it occurs in sentences little more abstruse than  (b):  Both men had  something  in common  (with  whom?  With  each other; then why not  the two,  or  the men,  or the  two men,  or simply  they}).  /  Lord Milner  had fixed  these  prices  because  the Food  Controller  and the  Board  of Agri- culture  both  disagreed  as to what they should  be,  and he had at least  the  wisdom to  fix a  price  that they both disliked  (the first  both  is  needless and misleading; the second is right). The  next  instance is  at once more excusable and more fatal,  both  for the same reason:  that hard thinking is necessary to get the thing disentangled:  This company has found  that the men they employ in America  can be  depended  on to  produce a  minimum of 40%  more  output than the  men they employ abroad, and yet these  men both in America and  elsewhere may be of the same  race  and nationality",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 quantity.,"The phrase should be banished  from the discussion of how to pronounce  English  words. The use of  it betrays the user's ignorance  that standard  English  teems  with  what are in  one sense or another  false  quantities. Its implication is  that,  with  some limi- tations or other, the sound of  vowels  in English  words derived from Greek and Latin  is decided by the sound in the words from which they come. But these limitations are so variously con- ceived  that  mere mention of  false quantity is valueless. Take  a  score of words about  the  pronunciation of which opinions differ, and on which classical  quantities might be expected to throw light; the  classical  quantities are  marked where they matter, and",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
false,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 quantity,"accents are added when acceptance of the  classical  quantity would naturally result in a particular stress:  amenity, apparent,  cànî'ne,  commû'nal,  corô'- nary,  deficit,  doctrî'nal,  equable,  glà'- dîôlûs,  idyl,  inter'necine,  meticulous, patriot,  salï'vary,  Salonï'ca,  semaphore, simian,  subsidence, tribunal,  vertî'go. It will be clear from this list  that adherence to  classical  quantity may operate  singly  or doubly, i.e. on the sound of a vowel only, or through it on the word's balance, and  that  the secondary  is much more noticeable than the primary effect; the difference between  patriot  and  patriot,  apparent and  apparent,  is slight, but  that  be- tween doctrî'nal  and  dô'ctrïnal, vertî'go and ver'tïgo, is very great. How little weight is to be attached to  classical quantity as an argument merely for one vowel sound against another will be plain from another score of ex- amples,  some of  them  actual Latin words, in which the unquestioned pronunciation is a  false  quantity: agent,  alien,  bônâ  fïde,  comic, cor- roborate,  decent,  echo,  ëthics,  et  cetera, fastidious,  idea,  jocosity  (and all in -osity),  military, minor,  mitigate, odour,  pathetic  (and most in -etic), senile,  solitary,  variety (and all in -iety).  It is useless to call out  'false quantity' to someone who  says  canine or idyl or  tribu'nal  or  amenity  when he can answer you  with  agent,  fasti- dious,  minor, or  echo.  The simple fact is  that,  in determining the quality of a vowel sound in  English,  classical  quan- tity is of no value whatever; to flout usage  and say Socrates is the merest pedantry. In its secondary effect, as an in- fluence  in  selecting the syllable in English  words  that  shall bear the stress, classical  quantity is not so negligible. A variation of stress being a much more marked thing than a vowel differ- ence,  the  non-latinist's  attention is arrested when a neighbour whom he credits  with  superior  knowledge springs doctrî'nal upon him, and  doctrî'nal gets  its chance.  Whether  doctrî'nal is right  is  another question; the superior- knowledged one knows  that  doctrina 187",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 scent,"has  a long i; but has he satisfied him- self  that  a long i, not in  doctrina  but in doctrinalis,  i.e.  with  no stress on it, has any  right to affect the stress of  doc- trinal}  Or  again,  has the Greek scholar  who knows  kînëma  and objects to cinema  reflected  that  cinema  does not represent  kinema  itself, but is a shortening of  cï'nemâ'tograph,  which again  has passed through French and indeed been  there  'assembled' on its way  from Greek to  English?  If he has, he will probably hold his peace. In many words, such as  canine, saline, vertigo,  the latinist's first thoughts (kânï'n,  sâli'n,  vertî'go)  do not call for similar  rethinking; but he has still to reckon  with  the  RECESSIVE-ACCENT  ten- dency,  which has as good a  right  to a voice  in the  matter  as his erudition, and will fight hard and perhaps vic- toriously, as it has for  kâ'nîn,  sâ'lin, and ver'tïgo. After all deductions, however, a small province is left in which the  false- quantity principle may fairly reign; if clematis  is pronounced  klëmà'tïs  and enema  ïnë'ma,  what has been done is this : in Greek words adopted  without modification, a syllable  that  in the original  is neither long in quantity nor stressed  has been wantonly made the stressed  syllable in  English;  they should be  klë'mâtïs  and  ë'nëmâ. But   on such  disputes  as those between  protâ'gonist  and  prô'tagô'nist, cô'mmunal  and commû'nal,  i'nter- në'cine, and inter'nëcine,  sâ'lïvary  and salï'vary,  mâ'rïtal  and  marï'tal,  cer'vïcal and  cervï'cal,  â'nthropoid  and  anthrô'- poid, its decision is not final; it is not judge,  but a mere party to the suit.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

far,"it is not there, and this requires more care  than might be supposed. The reader comes to a sentence not know- ing  what it is going to contain. The writer  knows.  Consequently what seems to the writer, owing to his private information, to bear unquestionably only  one sense may present to the reader,  with  his open mind, a different one. Nor has the writer even the satisfaction  of calling his reader a fool  for misunderstanding him, since he seldom hears of it ; it is the reader who  calls  the writer a fool for not being able  to express himself. The possibilities of  false  scent are too miscellaneous  to be  exhaustively  tabu- lated; the image of the reader  with  the open mind, ready to seize every chance of  going wrong, should be always present to the inexperienced writer. A few  examples, however, may suggest certain constructions in which special care  is necessary:  It was only after Mr.  Buckmaster,  Lord  Wodehouse,  and Mr.  Freake,  finding that they  were  un- able  to go, that the England team as now constituted,  but with  Major  Hunter in the  place of Captain Cheape, was de- cided  on.  The writer knew  that  after was  to be a preposition governing Mr. B.  etc.  finding  ;  but the reader takes it for a conjunction  with  a verb yet to come, and is angry at having to recon- sider.

fateful,"of  the obsolete comparative of  far (farrer),  seemed to need a respelling that  should assimilate it to  far.  This is  intended as a popular but roughly correct summary of the OED's etymo- logical  account. As to the modern use of  the two forms, the OED  says  : 'In standard  English  the form  farther  is usually  preferred where the word is intended to be the comparative  of  far y while  further  is used where the notion of  far  is altogether absent; there is a large  intermediate  class  of instances in which the choice between the two forms is arbitrary.' This seems to be too strong a state- ment  : a statement of what might be a  useful differentiation rather than of one actually developed or even de- veloping.  The fact is surely  that  hardly anyone  uses the two words for differ- ent occasions; most people prefer one or the other for all purposes, and the preference of the majority is for  fur- ther.  Perhaps the most  that  should be said  is  that  farther  is not common except where distance is in question, and  that  further  has gained a virtual monopoly of the sense of moreover, both  alone and in the compound furthermore.  The three pairs of quota- tions following are selected for com- parison  from  the  OED stores. 1.  Comparative  of  far:  If  you  can bear your  load no  farther,  say  so. —H.  Mar- tineau.  It  was  not thought safe for the ships  to  proceed  further in the darkness. —Macaulay. 2.

Intermediate:  Punishment cannot act  any farther than in  as  far as the idea of  it is  present  in the  mind. —Bentham. Men who  pretend  to  believe  no further than they can  see. —Berkeley On the whole, though differentiations are  good in themselves, it is  less  likely that  one will be established for  farther and  further  than  that  the latter will become universal.

"fatalism, determinism.","The  philo- sophical  distinction between the words cannot here be more than roughly sug- gested,  and is itself more or  less arbitrary.  F.  says  : Every event is pre- ordained; you cannot act as you will, but only in the pre-ordained way.  D. says  : You can act (barring obstacles) as you  will; but then you cannot will as you  will; your will is determined by a complex of antecedents the interaction of  which makes you unable to choose any  but the one course. That is, /. assumes  an external power decreeing irresistibly  every event from the great- est to the least, while  d.  assumes the dependence of all things, including the wills  of living beings, upon sequences of  cause and effect  that  would  be ascer- tainable if we were omniscient. The difference  between the two views as practical guides to life is not great; one assures  us  that  what is to be will  be,  the other  that  whatever is cannot but be; and  either assurance relieves us of responsibility;  but those are called determinists who decline to make assumptions (involving the ancient notion of  Fate)  about an external direct- ing  will. Such,  very roughly, is the difference between the two theories; but the popular distinction today is not be- tween the names of two contrasted theories, but between the name of an abstract philosophy and  that  of a prac- tical  rule of  life.  D.  is the merely intel- lectual opinion  that  the  determinist  or fatalist  account of all  that  happens is true;/,  is the frame of mind  that  dis- poses  one at once to abandon the hope of  influencing events and to repudiate responsibility  for one's actions;  d.  is regarded  as a philosophy, and /. as a faith.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Its proper  sense is practicable, 'capable of  being done, accomplished, or car- ried out' (OED).  That  is, it means the same as  possible  in one of the latter's senses,  and its  true  function is to be used instead of  possible  where  that might be ambiguous. A thunderstorm is  possible  (but not/.). Irrigation is  pos- sible  (or  /.).  A counter-revolution is possible;  i.e. (a) one may happen for all  we know, or (b) we  can  if we choose bring one  about;  but, if (b) is the meaning, /. is  better  than  possible because it cannot properly bear sense (a)  and therefore obviates ambiguity. The wrong use  off.  is  that  in which, by  SLIPSHOD  EXTENSION, it is  allowed  to have also the  other  sense of  possible, and  that  of  probable.

Popular usage  now sometimes turns it upside- down and speaks not only of a per- formance featuring a performer but also  of a performer featuring a per- formance.

female,"material  in  many contexts  which word should  be  used;  and yet we all know  that,  even  in  such contexts, one  and not the  other  is  nearly always idiomatic. A female is, shortly  put, a  she,  or, put more  at  length,  a  woman-or-girl-or- cow-or-hen-or-the-like.  The  noun  use is  the  original;  but,  like  all  nouns,  the word  can be  used attributively,  and through  the  attributive  use  this noun has  passed into  an  adjective.  The female  sex is the sex of  which  all members  are  shes;  that  is the  attribu- tive use; passing  to, or  rather towards, the full adjectival use, we say so-and-so is  female, meaning  that  it is of or for the female  sex.  Beyond  that  point  as an  adjective  female  has  not  gone.  Femi- nine,  on the  other hand,  is not a  noun that  has  gone  part  way to  complete adjectivehood;  it  has been  an  adjective all  its  life,  and  means  not  merely  of or for  women,  but  of the kind  that  charac- terizes  or  may  be  expected from  or is associated  with  women. This means that  there  are two  factors  in  choosing between  female  and  feminine,  (a)  that of  the  difference between  all  sex  and human sex,  and  (b)  that  of the  differ- ence between  the  noun-adjective  and the  true  adjective. The result  is  this : when  the  informa- tion wanted  is the  answer  to the  ques- tion  Of  {ox  for) which  sex?,  use  female, provided  that  the  context  sufficiently indicates  the  limitation  to  humankind; when  the  question is  Of  what  sort?,  use feminine.

Feminine  is the epithet  for beauty, features, arguments, pursuits, sympathy, weakness, spite, and  the  like.

"female,","woman.  F.  in its noun use is  sometimes convenient as a word  that includes  girls  as well as women, and sometimes as including non-human as well as human f. creatures.  Where  such inclusion  is not specially desired, to call  a woman a female is resented as impolite;  the noun has acquired the same  kind of disparaging overtone as INDIVIDUAL.  It is not  reasonable  to extend this resentment to the adjective use  of  female;  but this is  what  prob- ably  accounts for the apparent avoid- ance of the natural  phrase  /.  suffrage and the use of the clumsy  woman suffrage  instead. As  with  /.  education (for which see the preceding article), /.  suffrage  is short for the suffrage of  (of course, human) f. creatures, i.e.  women. In the first edition of this book the hope was expressed that  when the way women were going to vote came to be a common  theme  of discussion  it would be called  the  female vote  and not the  woman  vote;  for to turn  woman  into an adjective  with female  ready made would be mere per- versity.

feminine designations,"from the French usually carry  with them  their feminine forms  (masseuse, confidante),  but  not  always  :  an  artiste  for instance is not a woman painter. Latin words used in the law  also  keep their vernacular inflexions  (executrix,  testa- trix,  etc.), and so does at least one Greek word,  heroine.  Another common device is to use  lady,  woman,  or  girl attributively, as we speak of a  lady doctor,  a  woman teacher,  and a  girl student.  Here  there  is  a  risk of ambi- guity:  the first word in such com- pounds  may  be used not adjectivally but as a genitive : a  woman-hater  is not a  woman who hates nor is a  lady-killer a  murderess.  See  HYPHENS. These are, however, secondary ways of  forming feminine designations; the standard way has always been the use of  the inflexion  -ess.  This has been applied not only to occupational terms such as  abbess,  actress,  governess  (the feminine equivalent  of  governor  in its old sense of tutor-guardian),  hostess, seamstress,  shepherdess,  sorceress,  and many others, but  also  to  agent-nouns denoting more casual activities such as adulteress,  adventuress,  benefactress, foundress,  murderess,  patroness,  temp- tress,  and the like. Feminine designations seem now to be falling into disuse.  'The  agent- nouns in  -er  and the sbs. indicating profession  etc.',  said the SOED in Ï933J  <are now  treated as of common gender  whenever possible.'  With  some of  them  we have no choice. A woman ambassador  cannot be an  ambassadress, for  that  is the  title  given to the wife of an ambassador; nor can we pray for Elizabeth our Queen and Governess;  nor can a woman mayor be a  mayoress,  for  that  is a separate office to  be filled by one  of  her relatives. But such cases are few, and can have little to do  with  the curious fact  that  we are dropping these words at the very  time when it might be thought, as was said in the first edition of this book,  that 'with  the  coming  extension of women's vocations,  féminines  for vocation- words are a special need of the future'. Perhaps the explanation of this para- dox is  that  it symbolizes the victory of",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 designations,"women in their struggle for equal rights  ;  it reflects the abandonment by men of those ideas about women in the professions  that  moved Dr. Johnson to his  rude remark about women preach- ers.  Modern woman justifiably resents any  such implications.  She was a professional  sculptor {she hated the word  sculptress  as a  concession  to feminism) who had studied  her  art in Paris  and been a pupil of Rodin. We have not thought it necessary to coin new words such as  barristress, councillor  ess,  solicitress,  seer  etar  ess  ; we are content to say  my  Lord  to a woman sitting in a judicial capacity that  would entitle a man to  be  so addressed,  and we have not given distinctively feminine titles to women officers  in the Services. Even where feminine designations are available we do not make much use of  them. Cateress,  dictatress  (and  -ix),  directress, doctresSy  editress,  inspectress,  inven- tress,  oratress,  paintress,  presidentess, professoress,  tailoress,  tutoress,  all re- corded in the dictionaries, many of them  of impressive antiquity, are either wholly neglected or allowed to die gradually. (For  AUTHORESS  see  that article.)  Even the words ending  -man are sometimes preferred  to their -woman  counterparts, especially if the first  part  of the compound is of generic rather than particular significance. We say  airwoman  and  horsewoman  but not  chairwoman  (perhaps it sounds too like charwoman) or  alderwoman,  and we do not hesitate to  treat  such words as  craftsman,  houseman  (in the hospital sense),  sportsman, spokesman  as of common gender unless  there  is need to distinguish the sexes, as when we are asked to vote for the  sportsman  and sportswoman  of the year. Some  -ess designations  of course survive. It is natural  that  words like  abbess,  actress, deaconess,  stewardess,  wardress,  should do so,  for  in those occupations women have duties peculiar to their sex, but it is  less  easy  to explain why  hostess, manageress,  and  waitress  offer a  stout resistance  to the general  trend,  and proprietress  and  instructress,  and per- haps  poetess,  are more tenacious of 195 feminineness life  than most of the old  -ess  words. One or two of these we have indeed brought back into use for special purposes such as  conductress,  if  what she  conducts is a vehicle not an orchestra. But  what  we usually do today, if we must have a feminine designation,  is to use  woman  attribu- tively,  or sometimes, playfully and ignorantly   (see   SUFFRAGETTE),   the suffix  -ette. Conductorette  had a short life,  and few will wish a longer one to the more recent coinages  announcerette (by a gossip columnist),  drum-majorette (by the U.S. entertainment world), and stewar'dette  (by a shipping Une). Any capacity  to amuse  that  undergraduette may  once have had has now waned, though  the  word,  wearing  the label  'joe' or  'slang',  has made its way into the dictionaries.  In serious use  usherette alone  seems to have established itself.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

" feminism,","etc. The words on  record  in the OED are: feminacy, feminality, femineity,  femini- city, feminility, feminineness,  féminin- ism,  femininity, feminism, feminity.  Of these  feminacy, feminality,  feminicity, and feminility,  may be put out of court as  mere failed  experiments  except to the  extent  that  feminalities  has acquired a special meaning as 'the sort of knick-knacks  that  women like to have about  them'  (OED). Femineity,  -ineness, -inity,  and  -ity, remain as competitors for the sense of  woman's nature and qualities, none of  them  perceptibly  differentiated in meaning.  Feminineness  is a word that  does not depend on usage or dictionary-makers for its right to exist; it can, of course, be used;  femininity and  feminity  are  both  as old as the 14th  c. and have been in use ever since;  of the two,  -inity  is the more correct form, and has found greater favour, though  -ity  is more euphonious and manageable, and is as justifiable as  e.g.  virginity  ;  femineity  is a I9th-c. formation, needless beside the others. Femininism  and  feminism  should have meanings  different  both  from the above and from each  other.  Femininism should  mean  (a) an expression or idiom",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

few.,"i.  Comparatively f.   2.  Fewer number.  I. As will be seen from the newspaper extracts below, ugly com- binations  of  comparative(ly)  with  a  few and  few  are common. There is no possible  objection to  putting  the ad- verb  comparatively  before the adjective few,  as in  Comparatively  few  people  are in the  secret;  that  is a normal construc- tion not requiring comment apart from a  warning against the frequent misuse of  comparatively  when no  true  com- parison is expressed or implied (see COMPARATIVE).  But  a comparatively few  is quite another  matter,  and so is the  comparative  few.  The extracts now follow:  The one  beneficial  treatment  for such  men could not be obtained  excepting for  a comparatively few. /  Discussion  in and out of the House has reduced these to  a comparatively few points. / The comparative few  who take  season  tickets seldom  travel every day. It is remarkable in the first place  that of  an idiom now enjoying such a vogue no trace whatever should appear in the OED's quotations either for  few  or for  comparatively)  ; the explanation is doubtless  that  people of literary dis- cernment, and even the writers of books in general, recoil from such a monstrosity, or used to do so. It is indeed easier to call it a monstros- ity than to prove it one, because  a few is  itself an anomalous phrase, and therefore analogies for its  treatment are not  abundant;  we must make the best of the few available. The main question is  whether  the  few  in  a few  is a  noun, and therefore to be qualified by an adjective, or an adjective, and therefore to be qualified by an ad- verb.  There  is first the familiar  a good  few,  still current though collo- quial  ;  next,  there  are  a  good  many  and a  great  many,  extant  modifications of the old  a many;  thirdly, we know that  quite a few  and  not a few  are 197",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

fey,"English,  while  a  quite  few  and  a  not  few are impossible. These show sufficiently that  while  a  few  taken together may be modified by an adverb, a modifying word placed between  a  and  few  can only  be an adjective; in fact,  the/ezu  of a  few  is itself a noun meaning small number.  That  it can be followed by a plural noun  without  an  intervening  of (there  are a few exceptions)  is nothing against  this  ;  it is parallel to  dozen,  and hundred: a dozen  eggs,  a hundred men, where,  whether  of  is inserted or not, any  modifying word is an adjective after, or an adverb before, the  a {a round  dozen  eggs,  a  good  hundred men, but  roughly  or  fully  or  quite a dozen etc.).  Consequently, if  comparative(ly) is  to be sandwiched it must be  a com- parative  few,  but if it is to precede the whole, or if it is to  qualify  few  without a,  it must be  comparatively.  On this showing all the examples in the first paragraph of this article are wrong, the last as well as the others. The objection will probably occur to some readers :  What,  then,  about  a very few  ?  May we not say  In a  very  few  years all will be  changed}  The answer is, first, that  a  very  few  is no  doubt  the origin of the mistaken constructions, and second- ly  that  very  is here not an adverb, but an  adjective, as in  She is a very woman or  devil,  or in  Living on a very minimum of  food;  just as we can say  a  poor  or a  wretched  few,  so we can say  a  mere  or a  very few,  with  very  an adjective. It may be added  that  Very few  people were  there  is  better  than  A very few people  were  there,  because  few  means some and not many, while  a  few  means some and not none, so  that  few  is better  fitted than  a few  for combina- tion  with  words  that,  like  very,  express degree. 2.

Perhaps  the  story  of  Nero's fiddling while Rome was burning started  the decline. But the noun has escaped this taint,  and is a  partner  in  some most respectable   expressions— fiddle-back chair,  fit  as  a  fiddle.

Most literary men know some  Latin;  that  Latin is chiefly of the classical  kind, and a little of it is enough to make  them  aware  that  figer  e,  and not fixare,  is  the  classical  Latin for fix. Consequently they have always felt an  instinctive repugnance to the word fixation,  and, perhaps unreasonably, preferred to say  fixing  instead of it whenever they could, leaving  fixation mostly to those who need it in technical contexts. A technical  term  of chem- istry,  it has now been borrowed by the psychologists and, in the sense in which they use it, has become a POPULARIZED  TECHNICALITY.

OED  ;  and some discussion will  be  necessary. Unfortunately, full demonstration  is  hardly possible;  but several  considerations raise separate presumptions  in  favour  of  follows: 1.  It is  certain  that  we all say  as fol- lows  by the light of nature ;  it  is only  to the sophisticated intelligence  that  as follow  occurs  (or  would  the  reformers prefer  occur?). 2.  Similar  but  more obvious  mal- treatment  of  other phrases  suggests that  the  correctors  of  this may  also  be mistaken, though  it  does  not  prove that  they  are.  Consider  for  instance the phrases  id est  and  so  far as  concerns. Section  15  (4),  which deals with  persons (ea sunt,  all  present  and future  members of  societies)  entitled  to  receive  medical attendance.  The  author  of  this (why, by  the way,  does  he  stop short  of ii sunt  or  eae sunt})  would presumably like  Byron  to  have said  Arcades  ambo, ea  sunt blackguards both;  but  id  does not mean  that  Arcadian  or  those Arca- dians,  it  means  that  phrase.  Many of these  stalks  were  failures, so  far  as  con- cern  the  objective  success;  what  the writer means is  not  so  far  as  the  stalks or  the  failures concern success,  but so far  as our  discussion concerns  it. The familiar  as  regards  is liable  to the  same mutilation. 3.  The  phrase  as  follows,  which  is very  old,  no  doubt  originated  in  sen- tences where  there  was no  plural  in the neighbourhood  to  raise awkward questions.  The OED  quotes  (1426) Was  done  als  herfastfolowys  (  =  as here directly follows), and  (1548)  He openly sayde as  foloweth.  He  spoke  as follows may  be  taken  as the  type;  that  is ob- viously  not  a  piece of normal grammar; what would  be the  normal way  of  put- ting it?  He  spoke  thus,  which is,  at  full length,  He  spoke  so as  I  shall  tell  you,  or He  spoke  so as it  shall  be  told,  or  He spoke  so as the tale  follows,  whence,  by ellipse,  He  spoke  as  follows.  This  pro- gress  is  surely natural;  but it  is equally natural  in  His  words  were  so as  I  shall tell  you,  or  His words  were  so as  it  shall be  told,  or  His words  were  so as the  tale follows,  whence  His words  were  as fol- lows.  It is  true  that,  when  the  idiom was  being evolved,  it  was open  to its makers  to  say, instead  of  were  so as  the tale  follows,  zvere  so as  words  follow;  but they chose otherwise, hundreds  of years  ago, and  the  idiom  is  now fixed. No one would want to change  it  except under  the  impression  that  it  was  un- grammatical  ;  to  show  that  it  is no more ungrammatical than  the  innovation  is enough  to  condemn  the  latter.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

If  etymology is to be our guide, the question  whether  we are to  say  forecast or  forecasted  in the past tense and par- ticiple depends on  whether  we regard the verb or the noun as the original from which the  other  is formed. If the verb is original (= to guess before- hand) the past and p.p. will be  cast,  as it is in  that  verb uncompounded; if the verb is derived ( = to make a forecast) they will  be  forecasted,  the ordinary in- flexion  of  a verb. The verb is in fact re- corded  150  years earlier than the noun, and we may therefore thankfully rid ourselves of the  ugly  forecasted;  it may be hoped  that  we should do so even if history were against us, but this  time  it is  kind.

These outdoor costumes are often needed; not only may decency be outraged sometimes by over-plain speech; dignity may be compromised if  the person who thinks in slang writes also  in  slang.  To the detective who has arrested a receiver of stolen  property it comes natural to think and speak of the culprit as a  fence  but  that  is not what  will appear on the charge-sheet. What  is intended in this article is not to  protest  against  all  change of the indoor into the outdoor word, but to point  out  that  the  less  of such change there  is the  better.  A short haphazard selection of  what  are to be taken as formal words will put the reader in possession  of the  point;  a full list would run into thousands. It  must  be observed  that  no general attack is being made on these words as words; the attack is only on the prevalent notion that  the commoner synonyms given after each in brackets ought to be translated into  them:  accommodation (rooms);  adumbrate  (outline);  bear (carry);  cast  (throw);  cease  (stop); commence  (begin);  complete  (finish); conceal  (hide);  desist  (stop);  dispatch (send off);  donate  (give);  endeavour (try) ;  evince  (show) ;  expedite  (hasten) ; extend  (give)  ;  felicitate  (congratulate) ; locate  (find) ;  obtain  (get) ;  proceed  (go) ; purchase  (buy);  remove  (take  away); repast  (meal);  seek  (try, look for); summon  (send  for);  sustain  (suffer); transmit  (send);  valiant  (brave);  veri- table  (true);  vessel  (ship);  visualize (foresee).

A destroyer  is  a ship, and, though we never forget its shiphood, the reader is often helped if we  call it a destroyer; a  vessel  also  is a ship, but the reader is not usually  helped by  our  calling  it a  vessel.  Though to evince is to show, it does not help him to  call  showing evincing; what happens is first the translation of  show into  evince  by the writer, and then the retranslation  of  evince  into  show  by the reader.  Mind communicates  with  mind through a  veil,  and the result is at best dullness,  and at worst misunderstand- ing.

Only faddists will engage  in alien-hunting and insist on finding native substitutes for words that  supply a real need: those for instance for which  there  are no English synonyms  with  exactly the same shade of  meaning, such as  blasé, chic,  and naif;  or those  that  we have adopted as the standard name for the thing, such as  ballet,  coupon,  debris;  or those  that form  part  of""  the language of diplo- macy,  such as  bloc,  démarche,  pour- parlers,  or those  that  express com- pendiously  what  would otherwise need circumlocution, such as  enfant  terrible, tête-à-tête,  rendezvous.  Only fools will think it commends  them  to the English reader to decorate incongruously  with such bower-birds' treasures as  au pied de la  lettre,  à merveille, bien entendu, les convenances,  coûte que  coûte,  quand même,  dernier  ressort,  impayable,  jeu de mots,  par  exemple,  robe  de  chambre,  sans doute,  tracasseries,  and  sauter aux yeux; yet even these, even the abominations beginning  and ending  that  list, are in place as supplying local colour or for other  special reasons on perhaps five per  cent,  of the occasions on which they actually appear. Every  writer who suspects himself of the bower- bird instinct should make and use his own black list, and remember  that acquisitiveness  and indiscriminate dis- play  are pleasing to contemplate only in birds and  savages  and children.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

friable,"2.  PRONUNCIATION.  TO say a  French word in the middle of an  English  sen- tence  exactly  as it would be said by a Frenchman in a French sentence is a feat demanding an acrobatic  mouth; the muscles have to be suddenly ad- justed to a performance of a different nature, and  then  as suddenly recalled to the normal state. It is a feat  that should not be  attempted.  The greater its success as a  tour  deforce,  the greater its failure as a step in the conversational progress;  for your collocutor, aware that  he could not have done it himself, has  his attention distracted whether he admires or is humiliated. All  that  is necessary  is a polite acknowledgement of  indebtedness to the French  language indicated by some approach in some part  of the word to the foreign sound, and even this only when the difference between the foreign and the corre- sponding natural  English  sound is too marked to escape a dull ear. For in- stance,  in  tête-à-tête  no  attempt  need or should be made to distinguish French ê from  English  â,  but the calling it  tatahtd't  instead of the natural Eng- lish  tàtâtâ't  rightly stamps it as foreign; again,  tour de  force  is  better  with  no unEnglish  sound at all; neither r need be trilled, and  tour  and  force  should both  be exactly like the  English  words so  spelt. On the other hand,  there  are some French  sounds  so obviously alien to the  English  mouth  that  words con- taining  them  (except  such as are, like coupon,  in daily use by all sorts and conditions of men) should either be eschewed by  English  speakers or have these sounds adumbrated. They are especially  the nasalized vowels  (an, en, in,  on, un, am,  etc.), the diphthong  en, the unaccented  e,  and  u;  to say bong for  bon  is as insulting to the French language  as to pronounce  bulletin  in correct French is insulting to the man in  the  English  street; and  kooldësâ'k for  cul-de-sac  is nearly as bad. Anyone in  need of particular guidance will find in  an appendix to the COD a list of foreign  words used in  English  with both  their anglicized and their foreign pronunciations. The former show how a  speaker should pronounce each word in  English  if he would neither exhibit a conscious superiority of education nor be suspected of boor- ish  ignorance; it is at least as im- portant  that  those who know the foreign  language should mitigate their precision as  that  those who do not should be enlightened. Broadcasters, conscious  of the critical millions listen- ing  to  them,  seem specially apt to be carried away by their anxiety to pro- nounce impeccably. It is, of course, a tricky business, for we have no system. Sometimes when naturalizing a foreign word we  take  over its foreign pronun- ciation  (debris,  blasé);  sometimes we anglicize  it  (baton,  calibre)  ; sometimes what looks like the same word is given a  different pronunciation in different associations  (prë-  for  prima donna  but prï-  for  prima facie).  The broadcaster, determined to be on the  safe  side, tends to  give  a foreign pronunciation to every word  that  has a foreign look, and so, when taken unawares, may find him- self  slipping into such absurdities as saying  Capuld  for  Capulets,  confëdong for  confidant,  Blongsh  for  Blanche  and msh  for  niche.

fused participle,"properly  followed'.  The name was in- vented (  The King's  English,  1906)  for the purpose of labelling and so making recognizable  and avoidable a  usage  con- sidered by the authors of  that  book to be rapidly corrupting modern English style.*  A comparison of  three  sentences will show the meaning of the  term. 1.  Women  having the vote share political power  with  men. 2.  Women's having the vote reduces men's political power. 3.  Women  having the vote reduces men's political power. In the first, the subject of the sen- tence is  women,  and  having {the vote)  is a  true  participle attached to women. In the second, the subject is the verbal noun or gerund  having  {the  vote),  and women's  is a possessive case (i.e. an adjective)  attached to  that  noun. The grammar in these two is normal. In the third, the subject is neither  women (since  reduces  is  singular),  nor  having (for if  so,  women  would be left in the air without  grammatical construction), but a compound notion formed by fusion  of the noun  women  with  the participle  having.  Participles so con- structed,  then,  are called fused parti- ciples,  as opposed to the  true  participle of  No.  1  and the gerund of No. 2. We are given to ridiculing the  cum- brousness of German style, and the particular element in this  that  attracts most attention is the device by which a  long expression is placed between a noun and its article and so, as it were, bracketed and held together.  Where we might allow ourselves to say  This never  to  be  forgotten  occasion,  the Ger- man will not shrink from  The since 1914  owing to the world-war befallen destruction  of capital;  only a German, we assure ourselves, could be guilty of such ponderousness. But the fused participle is having exactly the same effect on English as the  article-and- noun sandwich on German, the only difference being  that  the German de- vice  is grammatically sound, while the English  is indefensible.

fused participle,"type, all exhibit  both  the bracketing capacity  that  makes this construction fatally  tempting to the lazy writer, and its repulsiveness to a reader who likes clean  sentences. In the last two may be observed a special fault often at- tending the fused  participle—that  the reader is  trapped  into supposing the construction complete when the noun is  reached, and afterwards has to go back and get things straight. No one is better qualified than Mr. Charles  Whibley to write the  biography of  W.  E. Henley; and  there  is  some  likeli- hood  of  the life-story  of that influential and strenuous  littérateur  from his hand appearing  before  the  close  of the year.  / The  machinery  which  enables  one  man to do the  work  of six results only in the others  losing  their job, and in  skill  men have spent a lifetime  acquiring  becoming suddenly  useless,  j  Regulations  for per- mitting  workmen  who are employed under the same employer, partly in an insured  trade and partly not in an in- sured  trade,  being treated . . .  as  if they were  wholly employed in an insured trade.  /  A  dangerous  operation,  in which everything  depends upon  the General Election,  which is an essential part of the  operation,  being won. /  We have to account  for  the collision  of two  great fleets,  so  equal in material strength that the  issue was thought doubtful by many careful  statisticians,  ending  in the total destruction  of one of them  .... It need hardly be said  that  writers with  any sense of style do not, even if they allow themselves the fused parti- ciple,  make so bad a use of the bad thing as is shown above to be possible. But  the tendency of the construction is  towards  that  sort of cumbrousness, and the rapidity  with  which it is  gain- ing  ground is portentous. A dozen years  ago, it was reasonable, and pos- sible  without  much fear of  offending reputable writers, to describe as an 'ignorant  vulgarism' the most elemen- tary form of the fused participle, i.e. that  in which the noun  part  is a  single word, and  that  a pronoun or proper name; it was not very  easy  to collect instances  of it. Today, no one who wishes  to keep a whole skin will ven-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 participle,"ture  on so  frank  a  description.  Here are some examples, culled  without  any difficulty whatever from  the  columns of  a  single newspaper, which would  be very justly indignant  if it  were  hinted that  it  had more vulgarisms  than  its con- temporaries. Each,  it  will  be  seen, has  a different  pronoun  or  name,  a  sufficient proof  in  itself  of  abundant material. We need fear nothing from  China developing  her  resources  (China's)./ Which  will result  in  many  having  to go into  lodgings  (many's).  /  It  should result in  us  securing  the best  aeroplane  for mili- tary  purposes  (our).  /  It is no  longer thought  to be  the  proper  scientific atti- tude  to  deny the possibility  of  anything happening  (anything's).  /  They  wish  to achieve  this result without  it  being  neces- sary  to  draw  up  a  new naval  programme (its).  / /  insisted  on  him  at  once  taking the bill down  (his).  /  The  reasons which have  led to  them  being given appoint- ments  in  these departments  (their).  /  He is  prepared  to waive this  prohibition  upon you  giving him  a  written undertaking  as follows  (your). It  is  perhaps beyond  hope  for a generation  that  regards  upon  y  ou  giving as  normal English  to  recover  its  hold upon  the  truth  that  grammar matters. Yet every just  man who  will abstain from  the  fused participle (as most good writers  in  fact  do,  though negative evidence  is  naturally hard  to  procure) retards  the  progress  of  corruption  ;  and it may therefore  be  worth  while  to  take up again  the  statement  made above, that  the  construction  is  grammatically indefensible.  At the  first blush every- one probably grants this  ; it is  obvious, in  any  sentence  so  made  as to  afford  a test  (e.g.  Women having the vote  reduces men's  power),  that  the  words defy grammatical  analysis.   But  second thoughts bring  the  comforting notion that  the  fusion  must  after  all  be  legiti- mate;  it is  only  our old  friend  occisus Caesar  effecit  ut,  which means  not Caesar when killed,  but  The  killing of  Caesar,  had  such  and  such  results  ;  why should  not  Women having  mean  The possession  by  women  of,  if  occisus  Caesar can mean  The  killing  of  Caesar?  The answer  is  that  the  Romans  did  resort 217",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 participle,"to sense-fusion,  but did not  combine it  with  grammar-confusion  ;  The deaths of  the Caesars  had  such effects  is  occisi Caesares  effecerunt  (not  effecit)  ;  but the fused-participlists  say  Women having the vote reduces  (not  reduce),  and  You saying  you are  sorry  alters  (not  alter)  the case.  The  Latin parallel  is  therefore  of no value,  and  with  it  goes  the  only palliation  of the bad  grammar. And  now, in  order  that  the  reader may leave this disquisition sick  to death,  as he  should  be, of the  fused participle,  a few  miscellaneous speci- mens  are  offered :  We  cannot reckon  on the unrest ceasing  with  the  end  of  one strike,  or on  its not  being renewed  in the case  of  other trades  (Compare  unrest with  its).

 participle,"218 demned  by Fowler. He  gave  numerous examples of its use by famous authors from Swift to Shaw; he made light of the argument  that  it defied grammatical analysis,  and maintained  that  it repre- sented 'the last step in a long line of development, the earlier steps of which ...  have for centuries been accepted by everybody.  Each step, including the last,  has tended in the same direction, to provide the  English  language  with  a means of subordinating ideas which is often convenient and supple where clauses  would  be  unidiomatic or  negli- gible.'  Fowler in his rejoinder (SPE Tract XXV) admitted  that  he had underestimated the  extent  of its use, but was otherwise unshaken.  'I  confess', he  said,  'to  attaching more importance to my instinctive repugnance  for  without you  being  than to Professor Jespersen's demonstration  that  it has been  said  by more respectable authors than I had supposed.' Thirty years later the dust had still not settled.  During the   passage through the House of Lords of the Homicide Act,  1957,  a noble lord, who must have been a disciple of Fowler, moved to purge the  Bill  of a  fused participle by substituting other's  for  other  in the clause providing that  it should no longer be murder for one party to a suicide pact to be 'a party to the other killing himself. He was  unsuccessful. But Fowler would have  been unlikely to accept even the House of Lords as a final court of appeal on such a point. It is clear  that  Fowler was right in deprecating the use of the fused par- ticiple  with  a proper name or personal pronoun in a simple sentence:  upon your  giving  is undoubtedly more idio- matic than  upon you giving.  But it is by  no means so clear  that  when a more complicated sentence makes a posses- sive  impossible we must deny our- selves  the convenience of writing  We have  to  account  for the  collision  of two great  fleets .  . .  ending in the total destruction  of  one  of  them  ....

It means not simply  'French',  but 'characteristi- cally',  'delightfully',  'distressingly',  or 'amusingly',  'French'—'so French, you know',  etc.—or  again  not 'of France', but 'of the typical Frenchman'.

Gallicisms.,"By  Gallicisms  are here meant borrowings of various kinds from French in which the borrower stops short of using French words without  disguise. 1.  One form consists in taking a French word and  giving  it an  English termination or dropping an accent or the like, as in  actuality  and  redaction. 2.  Another in  giving  to an existent English  word a sense  that  belongs to it only  in French or to its French form only,  as in  assist  (be present at),  im- payable  (=  priceless for absurdity, im- pudence, etc.),  arrive  {=  attain success etc.)>  exposition  (= exhibition), and actual  (= concerned  with  the present, topical,  The most actual and instructive article  is on  broadcasting). 3.  Another in  giving  vogue to a word that  has had little currency in  English but is common in French, such as veritable  and  envisage. 4.  Another in substituting a French form or word  that  happens to be Eng- lish  also,  but in another sense, for the really  corresponding  English,  as when brave  is used for  honest  or  worthy ,  or ascension  for  ascent. 5.  Another in literally translating a French word or phrase, as in  jump  or leap  to the eyes,  to  the  foot  of the letter, give  furiously  to think, knight of  industry.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
galore,"daughter of  joy,  gilded youth, the  half- world, colour of  rose,  do  one's  possible, to return to our muttons, suspicion  (= soupçon), and  success of esteem. To advise the  abandonment  of all Gallicisms indiscriminately  would  be absurd.  There  are  thousands  of English words  and phrases  that  were  once Gallicisms, but, having  prospered,  are no longer recognizable as  such;  and of  the  number  now on  trial  some  will doubtless  prosper  in  like  manner.  What the wise man does is to recognize  that the conversational usage of  educated people  in general, not his  predilections or a literary fashion of the  moment,  is the  naturalizing  authority,  and he  will therefore  adopt  a Gallicism only  when he is of  opinion  that  it is a Gallicism no more.  To use Gallicisms for the  worst of  all  reasons—that  they  are  Gallicisms —to  affect  them  as giving one's  writing a  literary air, to enliven one's  dull  stuff with  their  accidental  oddities,  above all to choose Gallicisms  that  presup- pose  the reader's  acquaintance  with the  French  original:  these  are confes- sions of weakness or  incompetence.  If writers  knew  how  'leap  to the eye' does leap  to the eye of the  reader  who, in dread  of  meeting  it, casts a  precaution- ary glance  down  the  column,  or how furious  is the  tliinking  that  'give furiously to  think'  stirs in the average Englishman,  they  would  leave  such paltry  borrowings  alone for  ever. Some of the Gallicisms  here  men- tioned,  as  well  as  others,  are com- mented  upon  in  their  dictionary  places. Words  and phrases for  which  the reader  is simply  referred  without  com- ment  to  this  article  are  to be regarded as  undesirable  Gallicisms.  See also",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

commonplaces,". When  Shylock hailed Portia as  A Daniel  come  to  judgement,  he was using a  generic name in the sense here in- tended; the History of Susanna was in his  mind. We do the same when we talk of an  Croesus  or a  Jehu  or a  Hebe or a  Nimrod  or of  Bruin, Chanticleer, and  Reynard.  When  we talk of  a Bar- mecide  feast,  of  IthurieVs spear,  of  a Naboth's  vineyard,  of  being  between Scylla  and Charybdis,  of  Procrustean regulations,  or  Draconian severity,  or an  Achilles' heel,  we are using allusive commonplaces. Some writers revel in such expressions, some eschew  them of  set purpose, some are ill provided with  them  from lack of reading or imagination; some esteem  them  as decorations, others  as  aids to brevity. They are in fact an immense addi- tion to the resources of speech, but they  ask to be employed  with  dis- cretion.

-genie,"company  will  only darken counsel in an- other;  most audiences are acquainted with  the qualities of  a Samson,  fewer with  those of  a Dominie Sampson and fewer still  with  those of  IthurieVs spear.  Nevertheless, to some audience or  other  each of these may well be, apart from any decorative value at- taching  to it, the most succinct and intelligible  name for  what  is meant. It is for the  writer  to see  that  he does not try Ithuriel's spear on those whose knowledge stops short at Samson; for if  the  test  reveals  them  as ignoramuses they will not like it, or him. It is perhaps  worth  while to call  atten- tion to a practical difference  between the useful and the decorative allusions. When  an allusive  term  is chosen be- cause  it best or most briefly conveys the meaning, triteness is no objection to it; intelligibility is the main  point. But the choice for decorative purposes is  a  much  more delicate  matter;  you must  still be intelligible, but you  must not be  trite.  The margin in any audi- ence  between  what  it has never heard of  and  what  it is tired of hearing of is rather narrow; it is necessary to hit it between  wind and water. These few remarks may suffice on the unanswerable question  whether  allu- sive  terms should be sought or avoided. The purpose of this article is not to answer it, but to  point  out  that,  if they are used, it is inexcusable and suicidal to use  them  incorrectly; the reader who detects his  writer  in a blunder instantly passes from the respect  that beseems him to  contempt  for this fel- low who after all knows no more than himself. It is obvious  that  the domain of allusion is full of traps, particularly for the decorative allusion- ist, who is apt to take the unknown for the fine, and to think  that  what  has just impressed him because he knows little about  it may be  trusted  to impress his readers.

The reader need hardly  be  warned that  the  inclusion  of any  particular word  in the  small selection  of  genteel- isms  offered below does  not  imply  that that  word should never  be  used.  All or most  of  these, and  of  the hundreds  that might  be  classed  with  them,  have their proper uses,  in  which they are  not  gen- teel,  but  natural.  Lounge  is at  home  in hotels,  step  in the  dancing  class, retire  for the  superannuated  man, and  so  forth;  but out of  such  con- texts,  and in the  conditions explained above,  the  taint  of  gentility  is on them.  To  illustrate  a  little more in  detail,  'He  went  out  without  shut- ting  the  door'  is  plain  English;  with closing  substituted  for  shutting  it be- comes genteel; nevertheless,  to  close the door  is  justified  if  more  is  implied than  the  mere  not  leaving  it  open: 'Before  beginning his story,  he  crossed the room  and  closed  the  door',  i.e. so  placed  it  as  to  prevent  eavesdropping  ; 'Six  people sleeping  in a  small room with  closed windows',  i.e.  excluding air.  Or  again,  'The  schoolroom roof fell  in, and two of the  boys  (or  girls, or children) were badly injured'; scholars  for  boys  etc.  would  be a genteelism,  and a  much more flagrant one than  closing  in the  previous exam- ple;  yet  scholar  is not an  obsolete  or archaic  word  ;  it  is  no  longer  the  natural English  for a  schoolboy  or  schoolgirl, that  is  all.  The  point  is  that,  when  the word  in the  second column  of the  list that  follows  is the  word  of  one's thought,  one  should  not  consent  to displace  it by the  word  in the  first column unless  an  improvement  in the meaning would result.

gerund.,"1.  G. and gerundive. 2. G. and participle. 3. G. and infinitive. 4.  G. and possessive. 1.  Gerund, gerundive. The second word is of importance only  with  regard to the  languages  that  possess the thing, of  which  English  does not happen to be one. But since its occasional use for  the other word  gerund,  which  M of  importance in  English  grammar, may  cause confusion, the difference between the Latin gerund and gerun- dive should be explained. The gerund is  a noun supplying a verb's  infinitive or noun-form  with  cases;  thus  amare to love has the gerund  amandi  of lov- ing,  amando  by loving,  amandum  the act of loving; correspondingly the word  loving  as a noun (but not as an adjective)  is the gerund in  English, though it is of the same form as the participle. From the same stem as amandi  etc. is formed in Latin an ad- jective  amandus  lovable, and this in Latin  grammar is named the gerundive as  being formed from the gerund. The English  adjectives formed in  -ble  from verbs,  like  lovable,  might well enough be called gerundives from their simi- larity  in sense to the Latin gerundive; but they are not in practice so called, and the  -word  gerundive  has accordingly no  proper  function in  English  grammar. 2.  Gerund and participle.  The  Eng- lish  gerund is identical in form, but only  in form,  with  the active parti- ciple;  loving  is a gerund in 'cannot help loving him', but a participle in 'a  loving husband'. A grammarian quoted by the OED  says  'Gerundives' [by  which he means gerunds] 'are participles governed by prepositions; but,  there  being little or no occasion to distinguish  them  from other parti- ciples,  we seldom use this name'. The distinction is, on the contrary, of great importance, and the occasion for mak- ing  it constantly occurs. In the article FUSED PARTICIPLE  an  attempt  is  made to show the fatal effects on style of disregarding  it.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

3.,"Gerund  and infinitive. Among the lapses  that  are concerned not  with  par- ticular words but  with  a  whole  class of  phrases, and  that,  without  being describable as grammatical blunders, reveal a writer's ignorance of idiom, few  are  more insidious  than  failure to recognize  when  the gerund  with  a preposition is required rather  than  an infinitive. /  look  forward to meet,  or  to meeting,  him} I aim to  remove,  or  at removing,  the  cause  ?  The  duty  is laid on us to do,  or  of doing, our  best} The  variety  of cases in which the question arises is so vast, and the rules that  should answer it would be so many and need so many exceptions, that  it is  better  not to try to formulate any.  Three  general remarks may suf- fice instead, to be followed by some specimens. A.  There  is very little danger  of using the gerund, but  much of  using the  infinitive,  where the  other would be  better.  B. Lapses are usually due not to deliberate choice of the worse, but to failure to think of the better.  C. The use of the infinitive is often accounted for, but not justified, by the influence of  ANALOGY;  because able,  or  sufficient,  or  adequate, to per- form  is English, we assume  that  equal to  perform,  which is to bear the same meaning,  must  be English too. In the specimens, where analogy seems to have been at work, the analogous word is  suggested in the correction bracket.

The ger- und is variously describable as an  -ing noun, or a verbal noun, or a verb equipped for noun-work, or the name of  an action. Being the name of an action, it involves the notion of an agent just  as  the verb itself does.  He went  is equipped for noun-work by being changed to  his  going,  in which his  does for  going  the same service as he  forgoes,  i.e. specifies the agent.  With the verb the agent is usually specified, but not  always;  it is seldom, e.g., used with  the imperative  (go,  not  go you  or you go)  because to specify  the  agent would be waste of words.  With  the gerund it is the  other  way; the agent is usually  not specified, but sometimes must  be, i.e. a possessive  must  some- times be inserted; and failure to dis- tinguish  when  this is required and when  it is superfluous leads to some ugly  or unidiomatic writing.  Scylla  is omission  of the possessive  when  the sense  is not clear  without  it; Charybdis is  the insertion of it  when  it is obvious waste of words ; but these are only the extremes, rarely run  into.

226,"Smith's,  and say  Jones  won by missing a chance  (as in fact he did, only the missing  was not his),  Scylla  has you. If  you say  He suffers somewhat,  like  the proverbial  dog, from his having re- ceived  a bad name,  you and your  his are in Charybdis. The second is a real extract;  of  Scylla  it was necessary to invent an  illustration;  but even Cha- rybdis is rare.  What  is not rare is some- thing  between  the two. It  will  be noticed  that  the reason why  that  his (with  having received)  was felt to be so intrusive is  that  the receiver is the same person as the subject of the sentence; compare Smith's missing, where  Smith's  was indispensable just because the  misser  was  not  the subject of  the sentence. Hence has come a sub- conscious assumption  that  the posses- sive  will be  omitted  if, and only if, the agent it would have  specified  is the same as the agent in the action denoted by the main verb, i.e. either the sub- ject, or, if the verb is passive, an agent following  by  or perhaps not even ex- pressed. The following sentences are bad because they flout this assumption; and, though they escape  both  Scylla and Charybdis, neither leaving out an essential  possessive nor using a super- fluous one, they offend against idiom by jumping from one agent to another without  giving notice :  By conniving at it, it will take too deep  root  ever to be eradicated  (By our conniving  would give  the necessary notice.  We shall  root it too deeply  would avoid the jump.

'The agent in the action denoted by the verb' was spoken of above, and not simply  'the  subject'. This complication",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
gesticulation,"was necessary because  there  is a com- mon  type  of sentence in which the possessive  is regularly  omitted,  and which would have seemed to contra- dict the rule if 'the subject' had been allowed to pass as sufficient.  That  type is  seen in  This  danger may be avoided by whitewashing the glass;  the agent of the whitewashing is not the same as the subject, i.e.  danger,  but is the same as  the agent in avoiding, i.e. the owner of  the plants  that  are not to be scorched; consequently the possessive is  not required. A few wrong forms are added  without comment:  Sure  as she was of her  never losing  her filial hold of the beloved.  / /  cultivated a  cold  and  passionless  ex- terior,  for I  discovered  that  by assuming such  a character certain  persons  would talk  more  readily  before  me.  / After fol- lowing  a country Church of England clergyman  for a  period  of half a century, a newly appointed, youthful vicar, totally unacquainted with rural life, comes  into the parish.  /  Grateful thanks to  the three Musketeers who  carried Mrs.  Pride home after breaking her leg  on Wednesday  (from a 'personal column',  quoted  by  Punch,  whose comment  is 'Least they could do').",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
"gesticulation,",,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 gesture.,"The  usual relation  between  the two is  that  of abstract to concrete: gesticulation is the using of gestures, and a gesture is an act of gesticulation. On the  other hand,  gesture  also is sometimes used as  an abstract, and  then  differs from gesticulation  in implying less of the excited or emotional or theatrical or conspicuous. Similarly, if  a  gesticula- tion  is preferred to  a  gesture,  it is in order to imply  those  characteristics. The use of  gesture  in political and diplomatic contexts,  =  advance, mani- festation of  willingness  to  treat  or com- promise or make concessions, exhibi- tion of magnanimity or friendliness, etc., is so recent  that  the OED  (1901) has  no example of it.

get.,"1.  Have got  for  possess  has long been good colloquial  English,  but its claim  to be good literary English is not universally  conceded. The OED  calls it  'familiar',  the COD  'colloquial'.  It has,  however, the authority of Dr. Johnson  ( f He  has  got a  good  estate'  does not  always  mean that he has acquired, but  barely  that he  possesses  it),  and has long  been used by many good writers. Philip  Ballard  in a spirited defence, citing not only Johnson but  also Shakespeare,  Swift, and Ruskin, con- cludes  'The only inference we can draw is  that  it is not a real error but a counterfeit invented by schoolmasters'. Acceptance of this verdict is here recommended. Perhaps the intrusion of  got  into a construction in which  have alone is enough originated in our habit of  eliding  have. I have it  and  he has it are clear statements, but if we elide we must  insert  got  to avoid the absurdity of  I've it  and the even greater absurd- ity of  He's it,  with  its ambiguity between  has  and  is.  See  also  DO  2. 2.  For  got to =  must  (I've got to go now)  no higher claim can be made than good  colloquial. 3.  Gotten  still holds its ground in American  English.  In British English it is in verbal uses (i.e. in composition with  have, am,  etc.) archaic and affected;  but as a mere participle or adjective it occurs in poetical diction (On  gotten  goods  to live  contented)  and in mining technicalities (  The hewer is paid  only  for the  large  coal  gotten;  There is  no  current  wage  rate per ton gotten) and in the  cliché  ill-gotten  gains. 4.

"grammar,",,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
" syntax,","etc.  There  was a  time  when  grammar,  in its  broadest sense,  might have been loosely defined as  the  science  of  language.  In  these days  of  scientific specialization  that will  no  longer do.  The  science  of  lan- guage  is  philology,  or, in  more recent jargon,  linguistics.  Grammar is  a  branch of  that  science,  and can be  defined  as the branch  that  deals  with  a  language's inflexions  {accidence),  with  its phonetic system  {phonology),  and  with  the ar- rangement  of  words  in  sentences  (syn- tax).  Other  branches of  linguistics  are: Morphology—How  words  are  made. Orthoepy—How  words  are  said. Orthography—How  words are  written. Composition—How  words  are  fused into compounds. Semantics—How  words  are to be understood. Etymology—How  words  are  derived and formed. Of these,  orthography,  accidence,  and syntax,  as the  bare essentials  for  writ- ing  and reading, represent  for  most  of us the whole of grammar; and  morpho- logy,  orthoepy,  phonology,  and  SEMAN- TICS,  are  meaningless terms  to the average  person. The last deserves  to be more widely studied  as a  means  of promoting clarity  of  thought  and an antidote  to the  habit  of  attributing  a numinous value  to  words. It  has  become fashionable  to  speak disrespectfully  of  grammar—a  natural reaction from  the  excessive reverence formerly paid  to it. The  name  Gram- mar  School  remains  to  remind  us  that the study  of  Latin grammar was once thought  to be the  only  path  to  culture. We took  a  long  time  to  realize  that there  is not  much sense  in  trying  to apply  the  rules  of a  dead synthetic language  to a  living analytical  one; perhaps  we  have  not yet  quite aban- doned  the  attempt.  'The  vulgar grammar-maker, dazzled  by the  glory of  the ruling language, knew  no  better than  to  transfer  to  English  the  scheme that  belonged  to  Latin.  What  chance had  our  poor mother-tongue  in the clutch  of  this Procrustes?'  (J. W. Hales,  quoted  by the  Departmental Committee  on the Teaching of  English",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
Grecian,"in  England).  Fortunately  in  this  mat- ter,  as in  others,  the  Englishman  has stoutly defended  the  liberty  of the in- dividual.  It  is, for instance, despite  the grammarians,  not  thanks  to  them,  that over  the  centuries  our  language  has won ease and grace by getting rid of al- most  all  its  case-inflexions; some  day perhaps this good work will  be com- pleted, and we shall no longer  be  faced with  the  sometimes puzzling task  of choosing  between  who  and  whom.  But it  is  going  too far,  if  we give  the  word grammar its proper meaning,  to  say, as Orwell said,  that  grammar  is of no importance  so  long  as we  make  our meaning plain. We have developed our own 'noiseless' grammar,  as  Bradley called  it;  what  are generally recognized for  the  time  being  as its  conventions must  be  followed by those who would write  clearly  and  agreeably,  and its elements must be taught in the schools, if  only as  a  code  of  good manners.

See  also  HELLÈNE. Greek g. There is something to be said  for retaining the hard sound of g even before  e,  i, and y, in such Greek- derived words as are not in popular but only  in learned, technical, or literary use.  To those who know some Greek the sound of  -ôji  in  pedagogy  or  jëri-  in geriatrics  or  fini-  in  gynaecology  either obscures  the meaning, which they would catch  with  the aid of the hard  g, or, if they happen to be prepared for it and  so do not miss the meaning, is still repulsive.  To those who do not know Greek, the sound of the words is im- material, and they might allow the other party the indulgence of a harm- less  pedantry  that  affects after all but a  few words. A list of deserving  cases is  given below  with  the pronunciations reminiscent of the Greek origin. In support of the proposed hard  g  it may be pleaded  that  the  ch  representing Greek chi is often or usually  hard  in similar  cases  (diptych,  trochee,  trichino- sis,  tracheotomy,  pachyderm, catechism, etc.).

It should now be added  that  this advice  was given in the nineteen- twenties.

half,"The other wrong form is seen in '  The country  finds  itself  faced with  arrears  of legislation  which for its  peace  and com- fort  had far  better  been  spread  over  the previous  years' '.  It ought to be  had far better  have  been  spread;  but the demon- stration is not here so simple. At the first  blush one  says:  This  had  is the subjunctive equivalent of the modern would  have,  as in  If the bowl had been stronger  My tale  had been  longer',  i.e. had far better been  spread  is equivalent to  would far better have been spread. Unfortunately for this argument it would involve the consequence  that You had far better done what I told you  must be legitimate, whereas we all  know  that  You had far better have done  is necessary. The solution of  the mystery lies in the peculiar nature of the phrase  had better. You had better do it; It had better be done; You had better have done it; It had better  have  been  done;  it will be granted at once  that  these are correct, and  that have  cannot be  omitted  in the last two. But  why? Because the word  had  in this phrase is not the mere auxiliary of mood or tense, but a  true  verb mean- ing  find;  You had better do it =  You would find to-do-it  better;  You had better  have done it  — You would find to-have-done-it  better. To  return  to the  arrears  of  legislation sentence, those arrears would find to- have-been-spread-over-the-previous- years  far  better,  i.e. would have been in  a  better  state if they had been so spread. This reminds us  that  there  is another possible way of arriving at the same sense;  The  arrears  would have been better if they had been spread  is compressible into  The ar- rears  had been better spread; better then  agrees  with  arrears,  not  with to-have-been-spread.   But  that   the writer did not mean to take  that  way is proved by the impossible order 'had better  been' instead of 'had been better'  (cf., in  Othello, Thou hadst  been better  have been  born  a dog);  he has perhaps combined the two possible forms,  one idiomatic, and the other at least  grammatical, into a third  that  is neither idiomatic, grammatical, nor possible.

It is a pity  that speech should have followed suit; the 1  i  ft.  of writing should be translated in  reading aloud into  afoot and a  half; and when, as in literary contexts, words and not figures are  to  be used, the old-fashioned  seven millions and a quarter  should not be changed into the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

halloo,"etc. The  multiplicity  of  forms is  bewildering;  there  are  a  round dozen at  the  least— hallo,  halloa, halloo,  hello, hillo,  hilloa, holla, holler,  hollo,  holloa, hollow,  hullo. Holler  may  perhaps  be put aside  as an  American verb,  hillo and  hilloa  as  archaic,  and  hollow  as confusable  with  another word.  Hello, formerly  an  Americanism,  is now nearly  as  common  as  hullo  in  Britain, (Say who you are; do not just say  'hello' is  the  warning given  in our  telephone directories)  and the  Englishman  can- not  be  expected  to  give  up the  right  to say  hello  if he  likes  it  better  than  his native  hullo.  Subject  to  this,  the  best selection from  the  variants  to  provide for  an  interjection,  a  noun,  and a  verb is  perhaps this :  Hullo  for the  interjec- tion  and for the  noun  as the  name  of the interjection;  halloo  for the  noun  as the name  of a  shout,  and for the  verb in dignified contexts;  holla  (with  past holla'd)  for the  verb  in  colloquial con- texts. We  thus  get:  Hullo! is that  you?; He  stopped  short  with  a  hullo;  The minstrel  heard the  far  halloo;  Do not halloo  until you are out  of  the wood;  He holla'd  out  something that  I  could  not catch.

hanging-up.,"The indicating of your grammatical  subject and leaving it to hang  up and await your  return  from an excursion is not common in modern writing; it belongs rather to the old days  of the formal period.  When  a writer of today does try his hand at it, he is apt, being a novice in the period style, to overdo things; the subject and verb are here italicized for the reader's  assistance  : 'A stockbroker friend  of the  Z—s  and of the  Y—s,  and then  Lord  Z—  himself, passed through the box before the  interest  of the audience,  which had languished as Lady  Z—  resumed her place at the Solicitors'  table, and  ""Babs"",  in her demure  grey  hat,  with  the bright cherries,  and her deep  white  fichu, struggled  through the crowd from the body of the  Court  in answer to the  call of  '  'Miss  Z—  X—'  ',  revived.'  Hanging- up may  also  result, especially in  OFFI- CIALESE,  from a writer's failure to look where he is  going  and just meandering along  until he reaches the verb  with  a bump.  'The  cases  where a change in the circumstances  affecting the fire pre- vention arrangements at the premises is  such  that,  if the number of hours stated in the certificate were recalcu- lated,  there  would be a reduction (or an  increase) in the number of hours of Fireguard  duty which the members concerned would be liable to perform for  the local authority in whose area they reside,  stand,  however, in an en- tirely  different  position/",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

It is even more advisable  with  hard  than with  other such adverbs  to  avoid  the  -ly alternative, since, as  the  following quo- tations show,  a  misunderstood  hardly will reverse  the  sense :  For  attendance on  the  workhouse  he  receives  £105  ayear, which,  under  the  circumstances,  is hardly 239",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 Street.,One  would naturally suppose  a  Harley  Street  physician  to be one  who has  a  consulting room  in  that street.  But  those  who  use the  phrase (mostly journalists) clearly  do not in- tend  it  to  have so narrow  a  connotation. Harley Street  is  only  one  of  numerous streets lying within  that  part  of the borough  of St.  Marylebone from which  it  has  long been customary  for most London consultants  to  practise; there  is  also  for  instance  the no  less important  Wimpole  Street—'that  long unlovely  street' where Tennyson used to call  on  Arthur  Hallam  and  Brown- ing  on  Elizabeth Barrett. Perhaps  the part  is  used  as a  name  for the  whole (an  example  of  SYNECDOCHE)  ; if so the attribute  signifies  no  more than  that the person  to  whom  it  is  applied  is a consultant practising  in  London  and therefore probably  to be  found  in  that district.

the,"peculiarities of headline language begin  to  corrupt  literary style it be- comes a  matter  of public interest, and protest is legitimate. The main peculiarities are  two;  both come from the need to economize space.  One is the constant use of short general-purpose words, mostly worn so smooth  with  over-use  that  any precise meaning they may once have had has been obliterated. Thus  bid  stands for any  form of human effort,  ban  for any sort of restriction or prohibition,  cut  or slash  for a reduction in prices or wages or anything else,  QUIZ  for any kind of interrogation, especially by the police (who are  cops  if constables and  sleuths  if detectives), and  swoop  for the activity that  may have preceded it. Any violent accident to a vehicle is a  crash;  to criticize is to  rap;  all agreements and treaties are  pacts;  all ambassa- dors and others on a mission abroad are  envoys;  couples may be wed but never married, and one may  quit  one's occupation but not abandon or resign it. The other  peculiarity is the omission  of articles and conjunctions and prepositions, leading, especially the last, to a monstrous abuse of our ancient and valuable right to use nouns as attributive adjectives.  MAC- MILLAN   REFUSES   BANK RATE  RISE LEAK  PROBE  will serve  as an  illustration,  PROBE  is the general-purpose headline word for an investigation  or inquiry, and the use of  bank-rate,  rise,  and  leak  as  attribu- tive adjectives saves  three  prepositions.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Semite.,"Persons to whom all these words are applicable are thought of by the modern Englishman as  Jews;  if he uses  in speech one of the other words instead of  Jew,  it is for some reason, known or possibly unknown to himself. He may be deliberately  discarding  Jew in favour of whichever of the others he first thinks of, and  that  either at the  bidding  of ELEGANT  VARIATION  or NOVELTY-HUNTING  or  facetiousness,  or for  the  better  reason  that  Jew  has cer- tain traditional associations, such as usury or anti-Christianity,  that  are un- suited to the  context.  Or on the other hand he may be not merely avoiding Jew,   but choosing one rather than another of the alternatives for its own sake.

The fact re- mains  that  Jew  is the current word, and  that  if we mean to substitute another for it, it is well to know why we do so. A remark or two of the OED bearing on the distinctions may be added: (On  Hebrew)  'Historically, the  term  is usually  applied  to the early Israelites  ;  in modern use it avoids the religious  and other associations often attaching to Jew' (it is  also  the only word for the  language,  ancient or modern) ; (on  Jew)  'Applied compara- tively  rarely to the ancient nation be- fore  ""the  Exile, but the commonest name for contemporary or modern representatives of the race; almost always  connoting their religion and other characteristics which distinguish them  from the people among whom they live, and thus often opposed to Christian,  and (esp. in early use) ex- pressing  a more or  less  opprobrious sense'.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

hectic.,"For a  h. moment. /  M.  Coué was taken up by  some  of our  h. papers, and then  dropped  because  he did not do what he never  professed  to do.  /  They have  got pretty well used to the  h. undu- lations  of the mark.  The blossoming of h.  into  a  VOGUE  WORD,  meaning  ex- cited, rapturous, intense, impassioned, wild, uncontrolled, and the like, is very  singular. The OED  (1901)  shows hardly  a trace of it, and explains its one quotation of the kind ('vehement and h.  feeling')  as an allusion to the h. flush —no  doubt  rightly. The  1933  Supp. adds  several examples and  calls  the usage  colloquial; the COD has down- graded  it to  slang.  Now a h. flush is one that  is accounted for not, like other flushes,  by  exceptional and temporary vigour  or emotion, but by the  habit (Gk.  l£is)  of body  called consumption. The nearest parallel to this queer development seems to be the use of CHRONIC  for severe, the only difference being  that  while  that  is confined to the uneducated or facetious this has had the luck to capture a wider area.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

utilitarian.,"The first (literally, 'ad- herent of pleasure') is a general name for  the follower of any philosophy, or any  system of ethics, in which the end or the  summum  bonum  or highest good is  stated as (in whatever sense) plea- sure. The Cyrenaic (follower of Aristippus of  Cyrene) is the hedonist in the word's natural   acceptation—the   pleasure- seeker who only differs from the ordi- nary  voluptuary by being aware, as a philosopher,  that  the mental and moral pleasures  are pleasanter than those of the body. The epicurean (follower of Epi- curus),  bad as his popular reputation is,  rises above the Cyrenaic by identi- fying  pleasure, which remains nomi- nally  his  summum  bonum y  with  the practice of virtue. The utilitarian (follower of Bentham and J. S.  Mill),  by a still more sur- prising  development, while he remains faithful  to pleasure, understands by it not his own, but  that  of  mankind— the greatest happiness of the greatest number. It will be seen  that  the hedonist um- brella  is a broad one, covering very different persons. Both the epicurean and the utilitarian have suffered some wrong in popular  usage;  it has been generally  ignored  that  for Epicurus pleasure consisted in the practice of virtue. We now apply  epicure  to one who is given to  refined  enjoyment of food and drink; and the utilitarian is  unjustly supposed (on the foolish",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

That  the  highest good is  pleasure, which  he  identified  with the practice  of  virtue.  2.  That  the gods  do not  concern themselves  at all  with  men's  affairs.  3.

heir.,"H.  apparent,  h.  presumptive. These phrases  are  often used, when there  is no  occasion  for  either and  heir alone  would suffice, merely because they sound imposing  and  seem  to im- ply  familiarity  with  legal  terms.  And those  who use  them  for  such reasons sometimes  give  themselves away  as either supposing  them  to be  equivalent or  not  knowing which  is  which.  Thus  : By the  tragedy  of  the  death  of  the  Crown Prince  Rudolph  in  1889  the  Archduke Ferdinand  became  the Heir Apparent  to the  throne.  Rudolph,  it  is true, was heir apparent;  but by his  death  no one could become  h. a.  except  his  child  or younger  brother (whereas Ferdinand was  his  cousin), since  the  Emperor might  yet  conceivably have  a  son  who would displace anyone  else.  An h. a. is one whose title  is  indefeasible  by any possible  birth;  anh.  p. is one  who will lose  his  position  if an h. a. is  born. Mistakes  are no  doubt  due to the double sense  of  the word  apparent.  Its old  sense,  retained  in  h. a.,  and  still possible  elsewhere  in  literary use,  but avoided  for  fear  of  confusion  with  the other and prevailing  sense,  is  manifest or unquestionable.

 Hellenic,"etc.  The  function of  these words  in  English,  beside  Greek etc.,  is not  easy  to  define;  but the use of  them  is  certainly increasing. They were formerly scholars' words, little used  except  by  historians,  and by persons  concerned  not so  much  with Greeks in themselves as  with  the effects of  Greek culture  on the  development of  civilization  in the  world  {Hellenism). With  the  modern spread  of  education, the words have been popularized  in such  connexions  (e.g.  H.  cruise,  H. games,  H.  Journal).  At the  same time the national aspirations  of  Greek irre- dentists called newspaper attention to pan-Hellenism  and to the  name  by which  the  Greeks  and  their king  call themselves;  so  that  the  proportion of  people  to  whom  Greek  means some- thing, and  Hellene  and  Hellenic  nothing, is  smaller than  it  was. Nevertheless, Greek  remains  the  English  word, into whose place  the  Greek words should not  be  thrust  without  special justifica- tion.  See  also  GRECIAN,  GREEK.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Out of  Don't  sneeze  if you can help it  is  illogically  developed Don't  sneeze  more  than you can help, which would be  logical,  though not attractive, if  cannot  were  written  for can.  And out of  Don't  sneeze  more  than you  can help  by a further blunder comes  Sneeze  as little as you can  help  ; a  further blunder, because  there  is not a  mere omission of a  negative—'you cannot  help' does not mend the  matter —but  a failure to see  that  can  without help  is exactly what is wanted : the full form would be  Sneeze  as little as you can  sneeze  little,  not  as you  either  can, or  cannot, keep from  sneezing.  The OED, which stigmatizes the idiom as 'erroneous', quotes Newman for it: Your name shall  occur  again as little as I  can help, in the  course  of these  pages (where  as little as may be  would have done, or, more clumsily, if the / is wanted,  as little as I  can  let it).  A  future edition of the OED will be able to add Sir  Winston Churchill to the defenders of  this sturdy indefensible :  They will not  respect  more  than they can help treaties  extracted from them under duress. Another indefensible use of  help,  not yet, we may hope, too sturdy for its growth to be checked, is the expression cannot  help but be,  a curious confusion between  cannot help  being  and  cannot but be.

Of words which, like  Herculean,  vacillate between this sound and  that  given by shifting  the accent back and making the  -e-  equivalent to  1,  most develop a second  spelling to suit; so  Caesarean or  Caesarian,  cyclopean  or  -pian, Aris- totelean  or  -Han.

The only other function retained by  historic  is in  the grammarians' technical terms historic  tenses,  moods,  sequence,  present, etc., in which it preserves the notion appropriate to narration of the past, especially  in the expression  h.  present, a  device for imparting vividness to a narrative which is not now so popular with  story-tellers as it once was.

This definition opens Robert Bridges's  essay  on  English  Homo- phones published in  1919  as Tract II of  the newly formed Society for Pure English.  He  went  on to emphasize  that true  homophones must be  different words  that  have, or have acquired, an illogical  fortuitous identity of sound; the  term  should not be applied to words  that  were  originally  the  same but have  acquired different  meanings,  even though they may be spelt differently. For  instance  draft  and  draught,  both meaning  something drawn (however different a thing), are not homophones as  are  air  and  heir, son  and  sun, vane and  vein. Of  homophones thus defined  Bridges compiled lists containing 835 entries involving  about  1,775  words, and on this evidence he submitted and argued the following propositions :  that  homo- phones are a nuisance ;  that  English  is exceptionally burdened  with  them; that  they are self-destructive and tend to become obsolete;  that  this  loss threatens to impoverish the  language, and  that  the 'South  English  dialect' (now often called the  'Received  Pro- nunciation') is a direct and  chief  cause of  homophones by its smudging of unaccented vowels (e.g.  lesson  and lessen),  the  loss  of trilled r (e.g.  source and  sauce),  and the failure to pro- nounce the  h  in  wh-  (e.g.  whether  and weather). For  some  later trends in  English pronunciation, which on the whole Bridges  might have thought faintly encouraging,  see the articles  PRONUN- CIATION,  RECEIVED PRONUNCIATION, and RECESSIVE  ACCENT.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
hon.,"That  this prefix may be an abbreviation of either  honourable  or honorary  is a source of some confusion to foreigners. It stands for  honourable in  reports of debates in the House of Commons, where members may not be referred to by name,  except  by the Speaker, but must be called  the  honour- able  member  for . .  .  (hon. and gallant  if a  member of the Armed Forces,  hon. and  learned  if a lawyer). It stands for honorary  when prefixed to the holder of  an office  (hon.  secretary,  hon. trea- surer,  etc.) and indicates  that  he is unpaid. As an abbreviation of  honour- able  it is  also  a  courtesy  title  of the sons  and daughters of viscounts and barons and of the younger sons of earls,  as well as of the holders of cer- tain high offices, especially Puisne Judges  in England and Lords of Ses- sion  in Scotland. (Privy Councillors and peers below the rank of marquess are  right  honourable;  so are Lords Justices  of Appeal, the Lord Mayor of London,  and the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and a few other civic digni- taries  ;  marquesses are  most  honourable and a duke  his  grace.)  The Hon.,  when used as a courtesy title, requires the person's Christian name or initial, not his  surname alone  (the Hon. James  ovj. Brown,  not  the Hon.  Brown),  a com- mon  mistake is to suppose  that  the Christian name is unnecessary before a  double-barrelled surname. The same applies  to  the prefixes  REVEREND  and  SIR.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

hope.,"In the OED, the examples  illus- trating the use of the verb are nearly 60 in  number;  of all these not a  single  one bears  the slightest resemblance or  gives any  hint of support to any of the sen- tences here to be quoted. This seems worth  mention as showing how mod- ern these uses are; in  1901,  the date of H in the OED, they could apparently be ignored.  That  they were not quite non-existent even  then  is shown by the fact  that  one of the offenders quoted below is Emerson, but it may be  safely  assumed  that  they were  rare  ; nowadays  the newspapers are full of them  and have been for  years.

hotpot.,"The first is nearest to the original  form (Fr.  hochepot  =  shake- pot) ; 2, 3, and possibly 4, are succes- sive  corruptions  dictated  by desire for expressiveness  or meaning when the real  sense was forgotten.  Hotpot  is standard in cookery; for other purposes hotchpotch  is now the prevailing form, and it would be best if the two later ones  might perish.

however.,"Several small points require mention.  1.  however,  how ever, how  ... ever.  In  everyday talk,  how  ever  is common  as an  emphatic form  of the interrogative  how {How ever can  it  have happened?).  Being  purely colloquial,  it should  not  appear  in  print  except  when dialogue  is  to be  reproduced. This does not apply  to  cases  where  ever  has its full separate sense  of at any  time or under  any  circumstances,  but it is then  parted from  how  by  some other word  or  words.  We  believe that  before many years have  passed  employers  and employed  alike will wonder  however they  got on without  if,  this should have been  how  they  ever  got on;  the  other order  is an  illiteracy  in  itself,  and the offence  is  aggravated  by the  printing of  however  as one  word. See  EVER. 2.  But  with  however.  But it  must be  remembered, however, that  the Government  had no  guarantee.  /  But these  schemes,  however,  cannot  be  carried out  without money.

The  undue deferring  of  however  usually comes from  the  same cause  as  here,  i.e. the difficulty  of  slipping  it in  where  it interrupts  a  phrase,  and  should  be recognized  as a  danger  to be  avoided. 4.  However  too  early.  It  should  be borne  in  mind  that  the  placing  of  how- ever  second  in the  sentence  has the effect,  if the  first word  is one  whose meaning  is  complete (e.g.  He  as com- pared  with  When),  of  throwing  a strong emphasis  on  that  word. Such emphasis may  be  intended,  or,  though unintentional,  may be  harmless;  but again  it  may  be  misleading. Emphasis on  he  implies contrast  with  other people;  if no  others  are in  question, the reader  is  thrown  out.

humanist.,"The  word  is apt to  puzzle or mislead, first because  it is  applied  to different things,  and  uncertainty about which  is in  question  is  often possible, and secondly because  in two of  these senses  its  relation  to its  parent word human  is  clear only  to  those  who are acquainted  with  a  long-past chapter  of history.  The  newspaper reader some- times gets  the  impression  that  humanist means  a  great  classical  scholar. Why? he wonders,  and  passes  on.  Another time  he  gathers  that  a  humanist  is a sceptic  or an  agnostic  or a  freethinker or something  of  that  sort,  you  know; again  he  wonders  why, and  passes  on. Another time  he  feels sure  that  a hu- manist  is a  Pragmatist  or  Positivist  or Comtist,  and  here  at  last, since he knows that  Comte  founded  the  Religion  of Hu- manity,  there  seems  to be  some reason in  the  name.  And  lastly  he  occasionally realizes  that  his  writer  is  using  the word  in the  sense  in  which  he  might have invented  it for  himself—one  for whom  the  proper study  of  mankind  is man,  the  student,  and  especially  the kindly  or  humane student,  of  human nature,  a  humanitarian,  in  fact,  in the popular sense  of  that  word,  as in  The Congo  is not a  unitary State,  and it is sad  that  humanists  like  Mr. N.-B. .  .  . seek  to  force  one  group  into  the  domina- tion  of  another. The original humanists were those who  in the  early Middle  Ages,  when all  learning  was  theology,  and  nearly all  the  learned were priests  or  monks, rediscovered  pre-Christian  literature, turned  their attention  to the  merely human achievements  of  Greek  and Roman poets  and  philosophers  and historians  and  orators,  and so  were named  humanists  as  opposed  to the divines;  hence  the  meaning  classical scholar.

hybrids and malformations. ,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
In,"terms of philology, hybrids are words formed from a stem or word belonging to one language by applying to it a suffix  or prefix belonging to another. It will be convenient to  class  with  these the words, abortions rather than hy- brids,  in which all the elements belong indeed to one language, but are so put together as to outrage  that  language's principles of word-formation. English contains thousands of hybrid words, of  which the vast majority are unobjec- tionable. All such words  as  plainness  or paganish  or  sympathizer,  in which a Greek or Latin word has become Eng- lish  and has afterwards had an English suffix  attached to it, are hybrids tech- nically,  but not for practical purposes. The same is  true  of those like  readable, breakage,  fishery, disbelieve,  in which an  English word has received one of the foreign elements  that  have become living  prefixes or suffixes;  -able, -age, -ery,  dis-,  though of Latin-French origin,  are all freely used in making new forms out of English words. At this  point  it may be well to clear the ground by collecting a small sample of  words  that  may be accused of being misformed in either of the senses explained  above—i.e.  as made of heterogeneous elements, or as having their homogeneous elements put to- gether in an alien fashion:  amoral, automation,  backwardation, bi-weekly, bureaucracy,   cablegram, climactic, coastal,  coloration,  dandiacal, flotation, funniment,  gullible,  impedance,  pacifist, speedometer.  (Extreme examples, still- born it may be hoped, are  breathalyser and  triphibious.)  An ill-favoured list, of which all readers will condemn some, and some all. It will not be possible here to lay down rules for word- formation, which is a complicated business;  but a few remarks on some of  the above words  may  perhaps instil  caution, and a conviction  that word-making, like other manufactures, should be done by those who know how to do it. Others should neither attempt  it for themselves, nor  assist the deplorable activities of amateurs by giving  currency to fresh  coinages  before there  has been  time  to  test  them. A great difficulty is to distinguish, among the  classical  suffixes and pre- fixes, between those  that  are, though originally  foreign, now living  English, and those  that  are not. Of the former class  -able  and  dis-  have already been mentioned as examples; to the latter -ation,  -ous,  -ic,  and  a-  (not), may be confidently assigned. But others are not so  easy  to place; how about  -nee {-once  and  -ence)}  An electrician, in need of a technical  term,  made the word  impedance.  'I want a special word' we may fancy him  saying  'to mean much the same as  hindrance,  but to be sacred to electricity ; I will make it from  impede  ;  hinder  makes  hindrance, so  let  impede  make  impedance.''  And why not?  Impede  and  -nee  are  both from Latin, so why should it be wrong to combine  them  ? Again, if  -ance  is a living  suffix it can be put straight on to a  verb  that  is now English even if it was  not so by origin; and  hindrance, forbearance,  furtherance,  and  riddance, all  from English verbs, are enough to prove  that  -ance  is a living suffix. So it",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
hybrids,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 and malformations 254,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
hygiene,"might plausibly be argued. The answer to  the  first argument is  that  if these combinations are made they should be made correctly; the word should have been  impedience  (cf.  expedient).  As to the second argument it is no longer true  to say  that  -ance  is a living suffix; suffixes,  like  dogs,  have their day, and to find whether  -ance's  day is today we need only try how we like it  with  a few  English  verbs of suitable sense, say stoppance  (cf.  quittancé),  hurriance  (cf. dalliance),  dwellance  (cf.  abidance), keepance  (cf.  observance).  By all means let the electricians have their  imped- ance,  but in the interests of  both  elec- tricity and  English  let it be confined to the former. Another suffix  that  is not a living one, but is sometimes treated as if it were, is  -al;  and  it will serve to illustrate a special  point. Among regrettable for- mations are  COASTAL,  creedal,  and tidal.  Now, if  -al  were to be re- garded  as a living suffix, it would be legitimate to say  that  coast  and  creed are  now  English  words, and could have the suffix added straight to  them;  but if  it is tried  with  analogous  English words  {shore,  hill, belief, trust),  the re- sulting  adjectives  shoral, hillal,  belief  al, and  trustai,  show  that  it is not so. The defence,  then,  would be  different— that  coast  and  creed  are of Latin origin, and so fit for the Latin suffix. But  then comes in the other  requirement—that if  both  elements are Latin, they should be properly put together;  coastal(is) and  creedal(is)  are disqualified at sight for  Latin by the  -oa-  and  -ee-;  costal and  credal  would have been free from that  objection at least. Such words may  be described as not hybrids but spurious hybrids; and whether the qualification aggravates or lessens the iniquity is a question too hard for  a mere grammarian. All  that can  be said is  that  the making of words that  proclaim themselves truly or  false- ly  as hybrids by showing a  classical suffix  tagged on to some purely  English vowel combination is a proof of either ignorance  or shamelessness. The best examples of such curiosities are per- haps those words in  -ometer(z.g.floodo- meter  and  speedometer),  with  their im- possible  English  vowels,  that  imitate the form of the Greek compounds such as  barometer  and  thermometer.  The wordmakers  have missed an oppor- tunity  with  meter',  we have an  English METER  that  we use in  gas-meter  and water-meter;  why could they not have given  us  flood-meter  and  speed-meter,  as they later  gave  us  ohmmeter  and  am- meter,  instead of our present mon- strosities?  The  classical  connecting vowel  -0-  is quite out of place at the end of an  English  word  ;  gasometer  gave the  analogy,  but  gas,  being a word native in no  language,  might fairly be treated as common to all, including Greek, whereas  flood  and  speed,  with their  double-letter  vowels,  were stamped as  English.  See -0-. It  will  not be  worth  while  to  pursue the matter  further, or to explain in detail why  each  wordin  the  above  'ill-favoured' list  is a correct or incorrect formation, since  complete rules cannot be given. The object of the article is merely to suggest  caution. A reference to it  with- out comment against any word in this book indicates  that that  word is, in the author's opinion, improperly formed for  a reason connected  with  the making of  words from different  languages,  but not necessarily specified in so slight a  sketch as this. And the article is intended only for the serious word- maker. It would be naive to  tilt  at the surprising  compounds  that  manu- facturers sometimes invent for their products,  as for  instance  when -matic  or  -vator  is treated as a living suffix  to indicate  that  the article so described works  automatically or cultivates the land. Such conceits are in  the same  class  as facetious mis- spellings  like  eezi,  kleen,  and  nu; sensitive  people may  find  them  dis- tasteful, but they are unlikely to corrupt   the   language.

hyphens.,"No  attempt  will  be  made here  to  describe modern  English  usage in  the  matter  of  hyphens;  its  infinite variety  defies description.  No two dic- tionaries  and no two  sets  of  style rules would  be  found  to  give  consistently the same advice. There  is,  however, one principle  that  seems  to  command at least  lip  service from  all  authorities. This  is  that  the  hyphen  is not an ornament  but an aid to  being under- stood,  and  should  be  employed only when  it is  needed  for  that  purpose. (For instance,  to  take random exam- ples  from contemporary writing,  the sense  is  radically altered  if the hyphens  are  omitted  in  The  Russians would  be  well  content  if  they  could 255",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

hyphens,"get  all-German  talks  started  on  some- thing  like their terms  and in  There is  stodge  as  well  as  sublimity hidden away  in  Bach's  200-odd  cantatas.)  'I am in  revolt about your hyphens'  wrote  Sir Winston Churchill  to Sir  Edward Marsh.  'One  must regard  the  hyphen as  a  blemish  to be  avoided wherever possible.'  The  purpose  of  this article is  to  suggest  certain conclusions  that seem  to  flow from acceptance  of  this dictum.  No one  should presume  to do even this dogmatically. There will  re- main  ample room  for  differences  of opinion whether  in  particular  cases  a hyphen  is  needed  as an aid to  being understood,  and  individual judgement will  decide. x.  The  primary function  of the hyphen  is to  indicate  that  two or  more words  are to be  read together  as a single  word  with  its own  meaning.  It is  always used  in  such phrasal  com- pounds  as  stick-in-the-mud,  ne'er-do- well,  happy-go-lucky. 2.  Composite nouns consisting  of a noun preceded  by an  attribute  can be treated  in one of  three  ways. Some  can be left alone  without  risk  of  ambiguity, post  office  and  motor  car  for  instance. Some  cannot.  In  cross  word,  meaning the puzzle,  and  black cap,  meaning  the bird,  the  words must somehow  be visually  linked  so as to  make  the dis- tinction  that  is  made  in  speech  by stressing  the  first. Usually such  com- posite words  are  first  hyphened  and then,  if  appearances  permit,  made  into  a single  word,  as  crossword  and  blackcap have  been.  'My  feeling'  says  Sir Win- ston  in his  protest  against  hyphening 'is  that  you may run  them  together  or leave  them  apart,  except  when nature revolts.'  And if it is  right  to rid our- selves  of  hyphens  as far as  possible  the sooner  they are  run  together  the  better. Combinations  of a  noun  with  an agent-noun take more kindly than most  to  consolidation,  e.g.  bookbinder, doorkeeper,  housemaster, pallbearer, platelayer.  In  other compounds nature does  sometimes revolt.  Seaplane  and seaside  make pleasant enough words; seaair  and  seaurchin  do not.  But  we can often  fall  back  on the  alternative  :  sea",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
hyphens,"air  and  sea urchin  are not ambiguous. What  is an aesthetically tolerable com- pound is a question  that  everyone will have his own ideas about. There are some who would reject such com- pounds as  publichouse,  porthole,  and loophole,  lest they should seem to sug- gest  the pronunciations  -chouse,  -thole, and  -phole;  others may think this over- nice.  (The COD would have us  write public  house  and  loop-hole',  it admits porthole  though insisting on  mast- head.)  In America they are  less squeamish than we are, and do not shrink from such forms as  coattails and  aftereffects. Compounds in which the  attribute follows  the noun (e.g.  court  martial, heir  apparent)  can ordinarily do  with- out hyphens, though a precisian will hyphen or consolidate  them  when they are used as verbs or in the possessive case  (he  mil  be  courtmartialled:  the heir-apparent's  death).  Nor, on the principle suggested in this article, is there  any need for the hyphens often used in compound designations of rank or office such as  Attorney General, Lord  Lieutenant, Vice Admiral, Under Secretary,  and scores of others. Here both  practice and  precept  are chaotic. Even  if we pin our faith to a  single current work of reference, it is not  easy to discover a uniform principle under- lying  such decisions as  that  we must hyphen  Field-Officer  but not  Field Marshal, Quartermaster-General  but not  Attorney General, Commander-in- Chief  but not  Secretary  of State, Lieutenant-Governor  but not  Lieuten- ant Colonel, Lord-Lieutenant  but not Lord  Mayor.  And if we try to get more light  by  turning  to another no  less authoritative work of reference it is discouraging  to be told  that,  on the contrary, we must hyphen  Field- Marshal  but not  Field  Officer,  and that,  in general, the advice  there  given has  little in common  with  that  of the first  except  its apparent arbitrariness. 3.  Composite adjectives when used attributively are usually given hyphens, mostly  with  good reason. They may be adjective  +  adjective  (red-hot, dark- blue)  or  noun+adjective  (pitch-dark, 256 hyphens sky-high),orsLd)ective +participle(e<wy- going,  nice-mannered),  or  noun+par- ticiple  (weight-carrying,  battle-scarred) or  verb+adverb  (made-up, fly-over)  or phrases such as  door-to-door,  up-to- date.  Noun  and participle compounds are specially likely to need clarifying hyphens.  The tailor-made  dresses,  /  He was  surprised  to  come  across  a man- eating  tiger,  I  Near the  hotel  is a  large moor  reserved  for  shooting-visitors  :  these do not give the same sense  without  the hyphens. When  the first word of the compound is  an adverb no hyphen is ordinarily needed, though one  may  often be found there. It is the business of an adverb to qualify the word  next  to it; there  should be no risk of misunder- standing.  To quote Sir Winston  again, '  Richly  embroidered  seems to me two words, and it is terrible to think of linking  every adverb to a verb by a hyphen.' But this will have to be done when the adverb might be mistaken for  an adjective.  A little used car  is not necessarily  the same as  a little-used car or  a hard working man  as  a  hard- working  man  or  extra judicial duties  as extra-judicial  duties.  In  pretty fair  guess on the other hand,  pretty  is unmistak- ably  an adverb and the reader does not need the guidance of a hyphen. So is over  in the sentence  others  may think this  over-nice  written  earlier in this article,  but  there  the hyphen saves the reader from being put momentarily on a  false scent  by  think this over.  This possible  confusion between adjective and adverb probably accounts for the unnecessary  hyphen  that  often appears with  well  and  ill,  and for the distinction drawn by the textbooks between  well- known  (attribute)  and  well known (predicate). It is  true  that  combinations of two or more words needing hyphens when used attributively can usually do  with- out  them  as predicates.  An ill  educated man  is ambiguous but  the man is ill educated  is not. We must  write  Up-to- date  figures,  a  balance-of-payments crisis,  the  Africa-for-the-Africans  slo- gan.  But hyphens would be worse than useless  in  The  figures  are up to date, a",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
hyphens,"crisis  over  the  balance  of  payments,  the slogan  'Africa  for the  Africans'. 4.  In  composite adjectives,  as in the nouns, hyphens  can  often  be got rid of by consolidation,  especially  of the participial compounds.  Panicstricken, thunderstruck,  seaborne,  aircooled,  and many others may  be so  written.  Adjec- tives  and  nouns formed from phrasal verbs  (a  put-up  job, a  knock-out)  must obviously  keep their hyphens unless they  can be  consolidated. Here again the Americans  are  ahead  of us :  they make  one word  of frameup  for  instance. We,  if the COD is  right, boggle even at  pullover.  The  Times  is to be con- gratulated  on  defying  the  dictionaries",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
and,"writing  of  breakthroughs,  holdups, makeup,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 and,"takeovers. 5.  Carelessness,  or  perhaps  a  laudable desire  to  economize  in  hyphens, some- times leads  to the  omission  of one where  it is  manifestly  a  case  of all or none.  Neither  can be  dispensed  with in  Two-year-old  horses,  three-quarter- hour  intervals, submarine-cable-laying ships.  Some  pretty  problems  in hyphening  are set by the  unpleasant modern habit (see  HEADLINE  LANGUAGE) of  forgetting  the  existence  of  preposi- tions  and  using  a  long string  of  words as  a  sort  of  adjectival  sea  serpent  (e.g. a  large  vehicle fleet  operator  mileage restriction  has now  been made impera- tive).  Those  who  like writing  in  this way  can be  left  to  solve their problems for themselves. Indeed many  of our difficulties  with  hyphens  are of our own making;  we can  avoid  them  by remembering prepositions and writing, say,  intervals  of  three quarters  of an hour  instead  of  three-quarter-hour intervals. 6. Prefixes follow  a  similar course. The hyphen used  at  first  is  later  dis- carded,  and the  word  is  joined  up except  where nature revolts. Here  too the British, unlike  the  Americans,  are curiously hesitant  about  taking  the second step.

hyphens,"daily  of  vowels,  may be an  impedi- ment,  but we are tco  timid  about  this. Having swallowed  coeval  and  coeffi- cient,  we are  unreasonable  to  strain at  coeducational.  There  is no  risk of  puzzling  the  reader  if we  write preeminent  or  cooperative,  though  con- sideration  for him may  make  us  write the abbreviation  of the  latter  as  co-op. We already  write  coalesce  and  coaxial without  fearing  that  they  may  suggest coal  or  coax; perhaps some  day we may  write  coworker,  as  Americans already  do,  without  feeling nervous about  the cow.  Some  new  words  with awkwardly placed vowels undoubtedly need hyphens.  We  cannot  yet  do  with- out  one in  de-ice,  but in  time  deice may look  no  odder than  deist. There  is no  apparent justification  for the hyphen  that  now  accompanies  all self-   compounds   except  selfsame, especially  as it  leads  to the  absurdity of  having  to  hyphen  the  un  in  such words  as  un-self-conscious.  Ex  on",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

To  hyphen  all the  words  is no remedy. Either  a  suitable conjunc- tion  or  preposition  must  be  substituted for  the  hyphen  or, if a  symbol  is  used in  the  middle,  it  must  be a  dash,  or perhaps  a  stroke (virgule). 8.

These solecisms, which would never be committed if the pronoun of the first  person stood alone  (brought  home to  I;  set I talking),  are curiously common when it is the second of two words governed by a verb or preposition. It is as though  and I  were treated as a suffix to the preceding word, forming a composite whole not admitting of inflexion. To Dickens it seems  to have been natural  that Nell's grandfather should say  Leave Nell and I to toil and work,  and more than a hundred years later it seems to have been no  less  natural for a broad- caster  giving  a serious talk to say These  things are for  the  betterment of you  and I.

-ic(al),"diate object is concerned. To those who can afford  time  to think also of the interests of the English language it may be suggested  that  there  are two desir- able tendencies to be assisted. The first of these is  DIFFERENTIATION. There are many pairs in  -ic  and  -ical, each form well established and in con- stant use, but  with  a difference of meaning either complete or incipient. The final stage of differentiation is seen  in  politic  and  political,  which are not even  content,  as usual, to share an adverb in  -ically,  but make  politicly  by the side  of  politically.  Between  econo- mic  and  economical  the distinction is nearly  as clear, though the seal has not been set  upon  it by a double provision of  adverbs  ;  most writers are now aware that  the two words mean different things,  and have no difficulty in choos- ing  the one required. This can hardly be said of  comic(al),  the short form of which is often made to do the other's work. And so the differentiations tail off  into mere incipiency. Every well- established differentiation adds to the precision and power of the language; every observance of an incipient one helps it  on  the way to establishment, and every disregard of it checks it severely. It is therefore clear  that  writers have a  responsibility in the  matter. The second laudable tendency is  that of  clearing away the unnecessary. When  two forms coexist, and  there  are not two senses for  them  to be assigned to, it is clear gain  that  one should be got rid of. The scrapping process goes on slowly by natural selection; some- times the determining cause is appar- ent, as when  hysteric, cynic,  ondfanatic, give  way to  hysterical, cynical,  and fanatical,  because the former have acquired a new function as nouns; sometimes the reasons are obscure, as when  electric  and  dynamic  supersede the longer forms while  hypothetic  and botanic  are themselves superseded. But  that  one or  other  should prevail is a  gain;  and it is a  further  gain if the process can be quickened.  With  this end in view, this dictionary states  about many  -ic(al)  words, in their places, which appears to be the winning side,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Among the names of  sciences, arts, or branches of study, are  a few words in  -ic  that  rank as real English;  the chief are  arithmetic,  logic, magic,  music,  and  rhetoric,  but the nor- mal form is  -ics,  as in  acoustics,  classics, dynamics,  mathematics,  physics,  politics. The  substitution of  -ic  for  -ics (dia- lectic,  gymnastic, linguistic, metaphysic, etc.) in compliance  with  French and German usage has the effect, whether it is intended or not, of a display of exotic learning, and repels the possibly insular  reader who  thinks  that  'English is  good enough for  him'.  It should be added, however,  that  the  -ic  and  -ics forms can sometimes be usefully  kept for   separate  senses;  thus,  dialectic might be reserved for the art of  logical disputation and  dialectics  for a par- ticular person's exhibition of skill in it ;  conversely,  ^personal  ethic  is an indi- vidual's  code of ethics and a  tactic  a particular exercise of the art of tactics. But  it is not  with  many words, nor on many occasions,  that  this need  arises, and it is not usually  with  this end in view  that  the  -ic  words are made. 2.  Grammatical number  of  -ics.  This is  not so simple a  matter  as it is some- times thought. The natural tendency is to start  with  a  fallacy  :  We say Mathe- matics  is  (and not  are)  a science ; there- fore  mathematics  is singular. But  there the number of the verb, whether legiti- mately or not, is at least influenced, if not determined, by  that  of  a  science. The testing should be done  with  sen- tences in which  there  is not a noun complement to confuse the issue: Classics  are,  or  is, now taking a back seat;  Conies  is,  or  are, easier than I expected;  What  are,  or  is, his mathe- matics like?;  Politics  are,  or  is, most fascinating;  Your  heroics  are,  or  is, 260",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

idiom.,"This dictionary being much concerned  with  idiom and the idio- matic, some slight explanation of the terms may perhaps be expected. 'A manifestation of the peculiar' is the closest  possible translation  of  the  Greek word. In the realm of speech this may be applied to a whole language as pecu- liar  to a people, to a dialect as peculiar to a district, to a technical vocabulary as  peculiar to a profession, and so forth. In this book, 'an  idiom'  is any form of  expression  that  has established itself as  the particular way preferred by Englishmen  (and therefore presumably characteristic of them) over other forms in which the principles of abstract grammar, if  there  is such a  thing, would have allowed the idea  in question to be  clothed. 'Idiom'  is the sum total of such forms of  expression, and is consequently the same  as natural or racy or unaffected English;  that  is idiomatic which it is natural for a normal Englishman to say or write. To suppose  that  grammatical English  is either all idiomatic or all un- idiomatic would be as far from the truth  as to suppose  that  idiomatic Eng- lish  is either all grammatical or all un- grammatical.  Grammar and idiom are independent categories; being appli- cable to the same material, they some- times agree and sometimes disagree",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
idiosyncrasy,"about particular specimens of it. The most  that  can be said is  that  what  is idiomatic is far more often grammati- cal  than  ungrammatical;  but this is worth  saying,  because grammar and idiom are sometimes treated as incom- patibles. The fact is  that  they are dis- tinct,  but usually in alliance. To give a  few illustrations :  You would not go for  to  do  it  is neither grammatical nor idiomatic  English;  /  doubt  that they really  mean it, The distinction leaps to the  eyes,  and  A hardly earned  income, are all grammatical, but all for differ- ent reasons unidiomatic;  It  was not me, Who  do  you  take  me  for?,  There is heaps of  material,  are idiomatic but  ungram- matical;  He was  promoted  captain, She  all but capsized, Were it true,  are both  grammatical and idiomatic.

 -cratic.,"The right spelling  (-sy,  not  -cy)  is of some impor- tance, since the wrong one distorts the meaning for all who have a  tincture  of Greek by suggesting a false connexion with  autocracy  and the many other words in  -cracy.  Those words are from Greek  Kpâros  power ; this is from Greek Kpâois  mixture. Its meaning is peculiar mixture, and the  point  of it is best showninthewordsthatdescribeBrutus: His life was gentle, and  the  elements  So mixed in him that  Nature  might stand up And say to all the world 'This was a  man'. One's idiosyncrasy is the way one's elements are mixed, and the near- est synonyms for it are  individuality, personality  or  *  make-up'.   But since all  these have positive implications not present in  idiosyncrasy,  the con- tinued existence of the latter in its proper sense is very desirable, and it should be  kept  to  that  sense. Thus it is  reasonable to say  that  a person has no personality or no individuality, but a  person  without  an idiosyncrasy is in- conceivable.  Since  idiosyncrasy  means all  the ingredients of which a  unit  is composed, and their proportions and reactions—a  valuable compound no- tion  that  we may be thankful to find compressed into a  single  word—it  is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In each of the follow- ing  quotations a more suitable word is suggested  :  It is an idiosyncrasy of this grumbler  that he reads his own thoughts into  the minds of  others  (characteristic). / For  one  reason  or  another — lack  of money,  lack of  men y  sometimes the idiosyncracies  [sic]  of  committees — the  library has been far less useful than it might have been to the  serious student  (fads).  I  I do not find him, though  he is very quick in  observing outward  idiosyncrasies,  a truthful or an interesting  student of the  characters,  the minds  and  hearts, the daily actions and reactions,  of men and women  (peculiari- ties).  /  Moreover,  it  [a liturgy]  is  desired as a  protection  against the  idiosyncrasies of  the minister, whether in his  doctrine or  its  expression  (vagaries).  /  There are several  kinds  of  food  freaks;  some  people have an idiosyncrasy to all fish, par- ticularly  shellfish  and  lobsters  (antipathy or  allergy). Idiosyncratic  is the adjective of  idio- syncrasy —unfortunately,  because it encourages  by an accident the con- fusion  between  -crasy  and  -cracy.  If idiosyncrasy  is a word  that  has a real value,  but should be much  less  used than it is,  idiosyncratic,  its hanger-on, should be  kept  still more severely in its place. The quotations show  that there  is a danger of its getting more vogue  than it deserves  ;  what  the reader feels  is not  that  his author has used the word in a wrong  sense—he  has  not— but  that  he would have done  better  to circumvent, somehow, the need for it: We continue to read for much the same reason  as  incites  a  Purple  Emperor  to feed  on  carrion,  a cat on mice, a queen bee  on nectar, the South Wind on a bank of  violets; we are in pursuit of the idio- syncratic  (ofwhat  appeals to  us).  /  What we  cannot help learning of their maker, or  discoverer — his  philosophy, his idio- syncratic  view of  things — is  there,  not",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Who, on the contrary, would not  guess  that  an idol of  the market-place was just any belief to which the man in the street yields a mistaken deference? The odd thing is that  no  better  instance could be found of  an idol of the market than the phrase itself, oscillating between its real mean- ing  and the modern misuse, so  that  the very  person who pours scorn on  idola fori  is often propagating one in the very act of ridiculing the rest. Well, 'tis sport to have the engineer hoist  with his  own petard.

It was admitted above  that  cases  were conceivable  in which the  if  and  the  when might be genuinely and separately significant.  Such  cases  arise when one desires to say  that  the result will or does or did not only follow, but follow  without  delay; they are not in fact rare, and if a really good writer allows  himself an  if and  when,  one such must have presented itself.

Illicit  also  covers  what  is impermissible though not necessarily illegal,  including logical  fallacies;  in its sense of  contrary  to law it is applied especially  to activities  that  the law allows  only subject to compliance  with certain conditions, e.g. gambling and the manufacture and sale of alcoholic drinks.

The usual dictionary label  for some specimens of it at least is  vulg.  ;  but the word  vulgar  is now so imbued on the one hand  with  social prejudices and on the other  with  moral condemnation as to be unsuitable. The property common to these lapses seems to be  that  people accustomed to read- ing  good literature do not commit them  and are repelled by  them,  while those not so accustomed neither re- frain  from nor condemn  them.  They may  perhaps be more accurately as well as politely called illiteracies than vulgarisms;  their chief habitat is in the correspondence  columns of the press.

illogicalities.,"The spread of educa- tion adds to the writer's burdens by multiplying  that  pestilent fellow the critical reader. No longer can we de- pend on an audience  that  will  be  satis- fied  with  catching the general drift and obvious intention of a sentence and not trouble itself to pick holes in our word- ing.  The words used must nowadays actually  yield on scrutiny the desired sense;  to plead  that  anyone could see what  you meant, or so to  write  as to need  that  plea, is  not  now permissible; all  our pet illogicalities will have to be cleared  away  by degrees. Though Milton might be excused or even commended for calling Eve fairest of  her daughters, the modern newspaper man must not  expect  pardon for simi- lar  conduct.  Sir  Ernest  CasseVs  Christ- mas  gift to the hospitals of £50,000 is only the latest of many acts of  splendid munificence  by which he has  benefited  his fellows  before  now.  If it is the latest of them,  says  the pestilent one, it is one of  them;  if one of  them,  it was given before now; but it is in fact given now, not before now; which  is  absurd. Take,  again,  the following comment on a quotation the commentator thinks unjustified:  Were ever finer lines per- verted  to a meaner  use?  We know well enough  what  he is trying to  do—to emphasize the meanness of the  use— and if  that  had been all it would have been  better  to  write  Never  were  lines perverted  to a meaner use',  that  com- ment  would be made weaker, not stronger, if changed to  never  were  fine lines  etc. and  that  again  would be further weakened, not strengthened, by a change  of fine to finer',  everything that  narrows the field of rivals for the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Masters,  it  is  proved  already that  you are  little better than false knaves,  and  it  will go near to be thought so  shortly.  Dogberry felt no uneasiness about  putting  it  that  way,  and  some writers  seem  to  agree  with  him:  A scepticism  about  the  result  of  military operations  which must have  had and probably  has had  a  damping  effect  upon the  soldier  (If  it  must have had,  it  cer- tainly,  not probably, has had).

The word is something of  a stumbling-block; the unlearned hearer or reader is not sure whether it and  imminent  are the same or different ; the Latin scholar feels  that  he does not recall  immaneo  in his Cicero, and wonders whether  {-ant  and  -ent  often playing  hide-and-seek  with  each other) mdno  may be the source instead of mâneo.  (The pronunciation  immdn'ent was  prescribed for BBC announcers in 1928  'to avoid confusion  with  immi- nent,  but this has fallen flat.) Under these circumstances it is thought by some  that  the divines and philosophers who chiefly affect the word should be asked  whether they would not  gain  in intelligibility  what they might  Lose  in precision by choosing according to context  between  indwelling,  pervading, pervasive,  permeating, inherent,  and other words  that  do not mystify us. 'All  which though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down', and shall  not venture to label  immanent  and immanence  SUPERFLUOUS  WORDS. The OED's note on the use of  immanent may  be useful to those who, not read- ing  philosophic and religious books, find the word an enigma when it makes one of its occasional appearances in the newspaper: 'In recent philosophy ap- plied to the Deity regarded as perma- nently pervading and sustaining the universe,  as distinguished from the notion of an external  transcendent creator or ruler.'",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

"immortal,","as a compliment to an author or one of his productions or personages,  requires to be used  with caution.

But, delicate as  the device may originally have been, it is now too well known to escape notice; and whether the reader will be offended or not depends on the exact depth  of his ignorance. There are few who will not be angry if they are reckoned to require 'the immortal Shakespeare',  or 'Don Quixote', or 'Pickwick  Papers';  those who can put up with  'the immortal Panurge', or 'Dob- bin', or 'Mrs. Poyser', will be rather more numerous; and so on in many gradations.

impact,"(n.) means primarily the striking  of one thing against another, a collision  and, by extension, its effect on the object struck.

"implement,","n.  and v. See  NOUN  AND VERB  ACCENT.  The  verb,  meaning  to carry  out (a contract  etc.),  is of Scot- tish origin. The following quotation is from  Elements of English Composition by  David Irving,  11th  ed.  1841:  'To implement,  signifying  to fulfil, is like- wise  derived from the barbarous jargon of  the Scotish  [sic]  bar.' As recently as  1933  the  SOED  still called the word chiefly Scottish.  Since  then it has taken England by storm and become almost a  VOGUE  WORD  with politicians,  officials,  and the  Press. Undertakings,  recommendations, promises,  and obligations are never now  fulfilled  or  carried  out  or  kept  or observed  or  performed  or  discharged; implemented  must  always be the word.

It is in fact noteworthy in more than one respect. First,  it means for the most  part  the same  as  implied,  and, as it is certainly",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
imply,"not  so  instantly intelligible  to the average  man, it  might have been  ex- pected  to be so  good  as to die.  That  it has  nevertheless survived  by the  side of  implied  is perhaps  due to two  causes. One  is  that  explicit  and  implicit  make  a neater antithesis than even  expressed and  implied  (all the  conditions whether explicit  or  implicit;  but  all the  implied conditions;  implied  is  much commoner than  implicit  when  the  antithesis  is not given  in  full).  The  other  is  that  the adverb,  whether  of  implicit  or  of  implied, is  more often wanted than  the  adjec- tive,  and  that  impliedly  is  felt  to be  (see -EDLY)  a bad  form;  implicitly ',  pre- ferred  to  impliedly,  helps  to  keep  im- plicit  alive. Secondly,  there  is the  historical acci- dent  by  which  implicit,  with  faith, obedience,  confidence,  and  such words, has  come  to  mean absolute  or  full, whereas  its  original sense  was un- developed  or  potential  or in the  germ. The starting-point  of  this usage  is the ecclesiastical  phrase  implicit faith,  i.e. a  person's acceptance  of  any article  of belief,  not on its own  merits,  but as a part  of, as  'wrapped  up in', his  general acceptance  of the  Church's  authority. The steps from this sense  to  unques- tioning,  and  thence  to  complete  or absolute,  are  easy;  but not  everyone who  says  that  implicit obedience  is the first duty  of  the soldier realizes  that  the obedience  he is  describing  is not properly  an  absolute one,  but one  that is  based  on  acceptance  of the  soldier's status.

A right  or  property  or  grant  is  impre- scriptible,  if""  it is 'not  subject  to prescription'.  What  then  is  prescrip- tion?  If  we exclude doctors' prescrip- tions,  most people take  it to  mean 'uninterrupted  use or  possession from time immemorial,  or for a  period fixed by  law  as  giving  a  title  or  right; hence, title  or  right acquired  by  virtue  of  such use  or  possession; sometimes called positive   prescription'—OED.   But clearly  'not  subject  to  prescription'  in this sense does  not  give  us the  meaning we want,  but  something very like  the opposite of it.  The  reading  of  the riddle requires  a  piece  of  legal  knowledge  that most  of us do not  possess,  viz.,  that there  is  another kind  of  prescription 'now commonly called negative  pre- scription', defined  as  'Limitation  or restriction  of the  time within which  an action  or  claim  can be  raised'—OED.

First, markedly Latin endings, as  opposed  to  nondescript ones,  pro- duce  in-\  unjust  but  injustice,  unable but  inability,  unquiet  but  inquietude, uncivil  but  incivility.  Second,  -ed  end- ings  have  an  aversion  to  in-  :  undigested but  indigestible,  unanimated  but  inani- mate, uncompleted  but  incomplete,  un- determined  but  indeterminate, unsepa- rated  but  inseparable, undistinguished but  indistinguishable,  unlettered  but illiterate,  unlimited  but  illimitable,  un- redeemed  but  irredeemable,  unreconciled but  irreconcilable.  Third,  -ing  endings have  a  similar aversion  to  in-',  un- ceasing  but  incessant, undiscriminating but  indiscriminate.  Fourth,  in-  tends to  be  restricted  to the  forms  that  are closest  to the  Latin, even  in the  very open-minded  -ble  group :  unapproach- able  but  inaccessible,  undestroyable  but indestructible,  undissolvable  but  indis- soluble,  unbelievable  but  inconceivable, unprovable  but  improbable.  Lastly, unaccountable  but  insurmountable,  and untnelodious  but  inharmonious,  are examples  of  apparent caprice fixed  by usage. The commonest cause  of  error  is  thus the existence  of a  familiar allied word beginning  rightly  with  the  prefix  that, in  the  word actually used,  is  wrong. One other  point  is  perhaps  worth stressing.  It is a  general  truth  that, while  it is  legitimate  to  prefix  un-, but  not  in-,  to any  adjective  of  what- ever form, those negative adjectives in  in-  that  exist  are  normally preferred to  the  corresponding  un-  forms;  but when  an  in-  (or  il-  or  im-  or  ir-) adjective  has  developed  a  sense  that is  something more than  the  negation of  the  positive adjective,  an  un-  form is  sometimes used  to  discharge  the merely negative function  without  risk of  ambiguity;  immoral  having come  to mean  offending  against morality,  un- moral  is  called  in to  mean  not  moral or outside  the  sphere  of  morality. Others  are  inept  and  unapt',  UN- ARTISTIC  and  inartistic; inhuman  and unhuman  :  UNMATERIAL  and  immaterial; UNRELIGIOUS  and  irreligious;   UNSANI- TARY and  insanitary;   UNSOLVABLE  and insoluble. A list  is  now given  of  the words about which  doubt  is  most likely,  with  a statement  of the  prefix recommended for  each;  the  recommendations  are sometimes supported  by  special  rea- sons,  but  sometimes merely based  on a  general impression  that  one  form  is more likely than  the  other  to  prevail.

 incidental.,"Two  ten- dencies  may be discerned. One is for the shorter form  with  its  less  familiar termination to be displaced by the longer;  thus we should more usually, though not more correctly, now write incidental  in such contexts as (shor- tened from OED examples):  All the powers  incident to any  government; Those  in the  highest  station have their incident  cares  and  troubles;  The  expedi- tion  and  the  incident  aggressive  steps taken; The incident mistakes which he has run into.  The other tendency, cut- ting across the first, is a differentiation of  meaning,  based on no real difference between the two forms, but not the less  useful on  that  account. This is  that,  while  incidental  is applied to side  occurrences  with  stress on their",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
incidentally,"independence of the main action, incident  implies  that,  though not essential  to it, they not merely happen to arise in connexion  with  it but may be expected to do so.

It would be well  if  the swallowing up of incident  by  incidental  could be checked, and a continued existence secured to it at least in the special uses indicated.

 the,"inferior  kind of journalist therefore likes  to impress his readers  with  com- prise.  The  frequent  confusion between comprise  and  compose  (for which see COMPRISE)  is an indication  that  include, which writer and compositor alike know all about, would be in general a  safer word. Given the two, however, it would be possible to  turn  our super- fluity to much  better  purpose than as  a chance for the stylish journalist. When  two words  have  roughly the same  meaning, examination will gener- ally  reveal a distinction; and the distinction in meaning between the present two seems to be  that  comprise is  appropriate when what is in ques- tion is the content of the whole, and include  when it is the admission or presence of an item.  With  include, there  is no presumption (though it is often the fact)  that  all or even most of the components are mentioned;  with comprise,  the whole of  them  are under- stood to be in the list. The Guards, for  instance, include the Coldstreams and the  Life  Guards, but comprise the Household  Cavalry  and the  Brigade  of Guards.  Comprise  is in fact, or would be if this partly recognized distinc- tion were developed and maintained, equivalent to be composed of, whereas include  is not.

 I.,"These were useful  words once:  indifferent  (sub- jective)  with  indifference  for the person who feels no preference for either of a  pair of things over the other, and indifferent  (objective)  with  indifferency for  a pair of things for neither of which a  preference  is felt. 'In choice of com- mittees for ripening business for the counsel'  wrote  Bacon,  'it  is  better  to choose  indifferent  persons than to make an indifferency by  putting  in those  that  are strong on  both  sides'— a  warning as apposite today as  three hundred years ago. But the words have  since lost most of their virtue. Indifferent  in its objective sense and indifferency  are well on their way to archaisms;  and, though we still use indifferent  and  indifference  in  the sub- jective  sense,  they are becoming rather stilted,  in conversation at any rate. /  am indifferent  (or  It is a matter of indifference  to me) whether you go or stay  is now more naturally expressed by  /  couldn't  care  less.  The fact is  that the whole family has been poisoned by  the popular use of  indifferent  in the sense  of 'rather bad', a euphemistic extension  of  its meaning neither good nor bad. This has gone to such lengths that  clergy  sometimes substitute  im- partially  in the Prayer for the Church Militant, lest the congregation should be puzzled at their praying  that  justice may  be indifferently ministered. 2.

The  English  dative now having no separate form, the i. o. must be otherwise identified, and this is done by  putting  it between the verb and the object (Hand  me  that  book; Call  me  a taxi),  and if it is to follow the object, 2 7 3",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 question,"is the grammarian's name for a modification of what was originally  a question in such a way  that it no longer stands by itself as a sen- tence, but is treated as a noun, serving for  instance as subject or object to a  verb outside of it. Thus: direct ques- tion,  Who are  you?;  indirect question, /  asked who he was,  or  Tell me  who  you are,  or  Who you are is quite irrelevant. Two points  arise,  one  of  grammar, and one of style. 1.  It must be  remembered  that  an indirect question is in grammar equiva- lent to one noun in the singular; the number of its internal subject has no influence  on the number of the external verb.  To  disregard  this fact, as when rest  is  written  instead of  rests  in the following  extract because  terms  hap- pens to be plural, is an elementary blunder— What  terms  Bulgaria  may be  ultimately given  rest  with the  Peace Conference. 2.  The point of style  is  of much greater  interest. How far is it legiti- mate, in an indirect question, to sub- stitute  the order of words  that  properly belongs  to direct questions? The lamentable craze for  INVERSION  among writers who are fain to make up for dullness  of  matter  by verbal contor- tions is no  doubt  responsible for the prevailing  disregard of the normal order in indirect questions; for inver- sion,  i.e. the placing of the subject later than its verb, is  a  mark of the direct, but not of the indirect question. Take these five types : A. How old are you? B.  Tell me how old you are or  Tell me how old are you?",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 question,"C. He wondered how old she was or  He wondered how old was  she? D. He doesn't know how old I am or  He doesn't know how old am I? E.  How old I am is my  affair or  How  old am I is my  affair. A  is the direct  question;  in B, C, D, and  E, the first form contains the normal, and  the  second the abnormal form of the indirect question. It will be seen  that  the abnormal form be- comes  progressively  disagreeable as we recede from interrogative governing verbs.  In B all  that  is needed to set things  right is a comma  after  Tell me, converting the indirect question  into  a direct one by making  tell me  paratactic. But  when we reach D the form might fairly  be thought impossible. To con- tortionists all things may be possible, but readers possessed of the gram- matical  sense,  or  of literary taste, will find the following examples of the abnormal order repugnant in the same degree  as the types to which the letters B  etc.  assign  themj  it is only the encroachments of inversion in general that  palliate this special abuse in in- direct",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

individual,"has  been said, but editors seem to relax their vigilance occasionally, and the word slips through on its sad old errand of  soliciting a smile in vain. Here are a  couple of  passages  in which the choice of  it can have been dictated  by  nothing but  WORN-OUT  HUMOUR:  It is a  most spirited  episode,  with a supernatural ending  according  to Tom Causey; this wily individual is the  hero  of  some  highly diverting  stories,  j Taking a  leaf  out of the  book  of the individual who  some years  ago  put  forth  his  recollections  under the  title  'Reminiscences  of a Young Man'.  Its use contemptuously rather than humorously (cf. Fr.  individu)  is hardly  less  outmoded.  That  was the sense  in which Mr. Jorrocks under- stood it when Mr. Moonface's refer- ring  to him as one provoked the  retort 'You are another indiwidual'  ;  and  that was  no  doubt  the significance intended by  the M.P. who in more recent times said  of a leading article  that  he thought unsympathetic 'The individual who wrote  that  leader does not live on £2.  los  a week.' The  test  for the right use of the word as  opposed to the  'colloquial  vulgarism' (OED)  is the question  whether  the writer  means  to contrast the person he calls  an individual  with  society, the family,  or some body of persons. If he does,  he may say  individual  with  a clear conscience  ; if not, he must  expect  us to like his evocation of this ghost of a past jocularity as little as we enjoy the fragrance  of the  smoking  room visited early  next  morning.

 deduction.,"The  first  is reasoning  from particular ('cited') cases to general principles; inferring of a law from observed occurrences. If I argue, from the fact  that  all the MacGregors I  have known are Scotch,  that  Mac- Gregor is a Scotch name, I make an induction.  Deduction is reasoning from the general to the particular; basing  the  truth  of a statement  upon its being a case of a wider statement known or admitted to be  true.  If I argue  that  I shall die because I have been credibly informed  that  all men do so,  and  I am a man, I am performing deduction. Whether  the conclusion reached by induction or deduction is  true  depends on many conditions, which it is the province of  Logic  to expound; but the broad difference between the two is that  induction starts from known in- stances  and arrives at a generalization, or at the power of applying to new instances  what  it has gathered from the old, while deduction starts from the general  principle,  whether  established by induction or assumed, and arrives at some  less  general principle, or some individual fact,  that  may be regarded as  being wrapped up in it and there- fore as having the same claim to belief as  the general principle itself.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

inevitable(ness).,"To  those  of  us  who read reviews  of  books  and  picture- shows and acting and music  it  has been apparent  for  some time  that  these words have been added  to  what  may be called  the  apparatus  criticus,  mak- ing  up, with other  LITERARY CRITICS' WORDS,  the  reviewing  outfit.  A  search through  all the  English  and  French dictionaries within reach when this book  was  being  written  showed  them all  ignorant  of the  specialized modern use;  the  OED  in  particular, dated  1901 for  the  letter  I, has no  inkling  of it. Even  in  1933  the OED  Supp.  gave only  one illustration,  and  that  puts  the word  in  inverted commas :  Illustrations of  French  wit . . . of the  'inevitable' phrase,  that gift  to the  world  past  all praise.  A  further example  or two may therefore  be  welcome :  And  even when a  song  is  introduced, such  as  Ariel's 1  Where  the  bee sucks  there  suck  I', its effect  is  so  great  because  it  seems  drama- tically inevitable.  /  The  mere  matters of arrangement,  of  line therein, show how great  was his  power,  how  true  his per- ception;  he  has  the  inevitableness  of  the Japanese,  j  Both themes  are  well, that is  to say  inevitably,  worked  out.  /  Miss may  not always  sing  inevitably and spontaneously,  simply  for the  love  of beauty.  The COD at  first called this use  of the  word  'critics'  slang',  but now recognizes  it  without  comment. What  the  critic means  by  inevitable is  perhaps this : surveying  a  work of art, we feel sometimes  that  the  whole  and all  the  parts  are  sufficiently consistent and harmonious  to  produce  on us the effect  of  truth;  we  then  call  it, for short,  convincing:  thus  and  thus,  we mean,  it  surely may have been  or  may be;  nothing  in it  inclines  us to  doubt. To  be  convincing  is but a  step short  of being  inevitable; when  the  whole  and the parts  are so  admirably integrated that  instead  of  Thus  and  thus  it may have been  we  find ourselves forced  to Thus  and  thus  it  must have been  or  was or  is 3  when  the  change  of a jot or  tittle would  be  plain desecration, when  we know  that  we are looking  at  the Platonic idea  itself  and no  mere copy,  then the tale  or the  picture  or the  music attains  to  inevitableness.  This  is an out- sider's  guess  at the  meaning; whether the  guess  is a  good  one or not, the meaning seems  to be one  deserving expression  in a  single  word—but  only on  the  condition  that that  word shall be strictly confined  to the  works  or parts  of  works  that  are  worthy  of it. Now  it is, in  fact,  so  often  met  with that  one  is  compelled  to  infer  the  exist- ence  of a  great deal more inevitability in  20th-c.  art of all  kinds than  one at all  suspected;  so  many things seem inevitable  to the  critic  in  which  the reader  could  contemplate extensive alterations  without  a  pang.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Their offence is here dealt  with  by a triple  bench;  the first member is a  correspondent  of a  well-known journal; the second is its editor, a meek man, it would seem; the third  is he who should have shared the writing of this book, among whose papers was found the cutting  with  his comment appended.* 1.  Sir,—May  I  appeal to your love of  accurate English against the com- mon use in writing, as in speaking, of the word 'infinitely' as equivalent to 'considerably'  or  'indefinitely'?—you write  that  'oil is infinitely  less  bulky than coal in proportion to the energy derived from it'. You  write  that  'the habitual loafer does infinite mischief. In the first case you intend 'consider- ably*  and in the second case you can only  mean  that  the mischief is indefi- nite, sometimes great, sometimes no worse than this  letter  from your obedient servant, AN HABITUAL LOAFER  OF NECESSITY. 2.  We stand corrected. Our use was a  vulgarism. And yet we must not run into a taboo  of  this noble word. Swin- burne uses it finely, accurately, and therefore  without  vulgarity, in the line 'In the infinite spirit is room for the pulse of an infinite pain'. There the use is exact, because it does not imply mere  magnitude.—Ed. 3.  Rot.  Infinite  is no more a vulgar- ism  than any other deliberate exag- geration.  And  indefinitely  is a totally wrong substitute; I have known at least  one-person  habitually use it,  with ludicrous effect. It  was  naughty of  that  Editor, though, to say  infinite  and  then  take his punish- ment  lying down. *  F. G. Fowler (d.  1918),  brother  of H.  W.

Latin  scholars, aware  that  boihfrango and  infringo  are transitive only, will probably start  with  a prejudice against upon;  but Latin is not English, as some of  them  know. A study of the OED examples leaves no  doubt  about  which construction has predominated from the  16th  to the  19th  c;  there  are 25  quotations for the transitive verb to 4 for  on  or  upon.  But 20th-c. newspaper columns give a very differ- ent impression; from  them  one would infer  that  infringe  can no longer stand at all  without  upon  :  Is it wise to  i.  upon their  rights and  susceptibilities?  /  You are  infringing on  our  prerogative  and trespassing  on some of the  ground  that we  intend taking up  later,  j It is sud- denly desired to  i.  upon  and  restrict  my Sovereign  rights. What  seems to have been happening is  that  (1)  an imperfect knowledge of Latin  has suggested  that  infringo  means break in = intrude, whereas it really means break in = damage or violate or  weaken;  (2) it has therefore been identified  in sense  with  trespass and encroach and assimilated to  them  in construction, this being  further  helped by confusion  with  impinge  upon;  (3) pretentious writers like to escape from encroach and trespass, familiar words, to  i.,  which will  better  impress readers with  their mastery of the unfamiliar. The advice here tendered is  (1)  to con- ceive  i.  as a synonym rather of  violate and  transgress  than of  encroach  and trespass;  (2) to abstain altogether from i. upon  as an erroneous phrase; (3) to use  i.  boldly  with  right,  rule, law, privilege,  patent,  sovereignty,  boundary, restriction,  constitution,  or the like, as object; and (4) when the  temptation to insert  on  or  upon  becomes over- powering, as it chiefly does before words like  domain  and  territory,  to be contented  with  trespass  or  encroach rather than say  i.  upon.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 intellectual.,"While an intelligent  person is merely one who is  not stupid or slow-witted, an intel- lectual person is one in  whom  the  part played  by the mind as distinguished from the emotions and perceptions is greater  than in the average man. An intellectual person who was not intelli- gent  would  be,  though not impossible, a  rarity  ; but an intelligent person who is  not intellectual we most of us flatter ourselves  we can find in the looking- glass.  Intelligent  is always a commenda- tory though sometimes a patronizing epithet;  intellectual,  though implying the possession of qualities we should all  like to have, is tainted in the com- munist ideology by its use in disparag- ing  contrast to  workers',  elsewhere too it is seldom untinged by suspicion or dislike—called  by a leader-writer in the  TLS  'a rather fly-blown word beloved only of  sociologists'.  The same writer  reminds us  that  Bertrand Rus- sell  once  wrote  to a correspondent 'I have  never called myself an intellec- tual, and nobody has ever dared to  call me one in my presence. I think an intellectual may be  defined  as a person who pretends to have more intellect than he has, and I  hope  this  definition does  not fit me.' This echoes the opinion of Bishop Parker in the  17th c.  : 'These  pure  and seraphic intellec- tualists,  forsooth, despise all sensible knowledge  as too  grosse  and materiall for  their nice and curious  faculties.' That  is not unlike the  definition given  by the OED Supp. of the colloquial  equivalent  highbrow  (U.S. egghead)  as 'a person of superior intellectual attainments or interests: always  with  derisive implications of conscious   superiority to ordinary human standards'. intelligentsia  is a word coined in Russia  about  1870  and  originally  ap- plied to intellectuals associated  with the revolutionary movement. After the revolution its meaning changed; the official  Soviet definition is 'a  social stratum consisting of people profes-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
intended,"sionally  occupied in mental work'. As these include not only those who fol- low  the arts and professions but  also white-collar workers generally, the word seems to have become in its country of origin little more than a polite name for what used tc be called the  upper  middle  classes.  Elsewhere it has  never found much favour, and it is now an outmoded word  with  its leftist colouring  washed out of it.  Attempts by  the Oxford Dictionaries to define it are  'The  class  of society to which culture, superior intelligence, and ad- vanced political views are  attributed' (OED Supp. and  OID),  'The  class consisting  of the educated portion of  the population and regarded as capable of forming public opinion (SOED),  'The  part  of a nation  that aspires   to  independent  thinking' (COD).",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
"intended,","n. It is curious  that  be- trothed  people should find it so diffi- cult to hit upon a comfortable word to describe each other by. 'My intended', 'my  fiancé(e)\  'my sweetheart', 'my love(r)',  'my young  (wo)man',  'my boy (girl)  friend', 'my  future  wife (hus- band)',  'my wife (husband) to be'— none of these is much to their taste, too emotional, or too French,  or  too vulgar, or too evasive. The last two objections are  in fact one; evasion of plain words is  vulgarity, and 'my intended'  gives the impression  that  the poor things are shy  of specifying the bond between them,  an ill-bred shyness; so too  with 'my engaged', and the modern word, 'steady',  does  not necessarily imply serious  intentions. And so in  fiancé(e) they resort to French instead of vague English  for their embarrassing though futile  disguise.  It is no  doubt  too late to suggest  that  another chance should be given to  betrothed.  It means just what it should, i.e. pledged to be married, and is not vulgarized and would be a dignified word for public use.  But it is so out of fashion as to sound facetious. intensive.

intensive,"liked the  better  for their mere length, so  intensive  has become a fashionable word where the meaning wanted is simply  intense.  It must be admitted that  there  was a time before  DIFFEREN- TIATION  had taken place when Burton, e.g.,  could  write  A very  intensive  plea- sure  follows the  passion;  it  there  means intense, but the OED labels the use obsolete, and its latest quotation for it is  from over two centuries ago. The modern relapse had not come under its notice in  1901,  when  letter  I was issued;  nor is it mentioned in the  1933 Supp.  Intensive  perished as a mere variant of  intense,  but remained  with a  philosophic or scientific meaning, as an  antithesis to  extensive;  where  exten- sive  means  with  regard to  extent,  in- tensive  means  with  regard to force or degree:  The  record  of an intensive as well  as extensive development.  /  Its intensive,  like its extensive,  magnitude is small.  This is the kind of word  that we ordinary mortals do well to leave alone;  see POPULARIZED TECHNICALI- TIES.  Unfortunately, a particular tech- nical  application of the philosophic use emerged into general notice, and was  misinterpreted—intensive  method especially  of cultivation. To increase the supply of wheat you may sow two acres  instead of  one—increase  the extent—or  you may use more fer- tilizers  and care on your one  acre— increase  the  intensity—;  the second plan is intensive cultivation, the essence  of it being concentration on a  limited area. Familiarized by the newspapers  with  intensive cultivation, which most of us took to be a fine name for very hard or intense work by  the farmers, we all became eager to show off our new word, and took to saying  intensive  where  intense  used to be good enough for us. The war  gave this a great fillip by finding the corre- spondents another peg to hang  inten- sive  on— bombardment.  There is a kind of  bombardment  that  may  be accur- ately  called intensive; it is what in earlier  wars we called concentrated fire,  a  phrase  that  has the advantage of  being open to no misunderstanding; the fire converges upon a much nar-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

internecine,"has suffered an odd fate : being mainly a literary or educated man's word, it is yet neither pro- nounced in the scholarly way nor allowed its Latin meaning.  Strictly  it should be called  ïnter'nèsïn  but it is in fact  called  interne'sïn;  see   FALSE QUANTITY.  And the  sense  has had the Kilkenny-cat notion  imported  into it because mutuality is the idea con- veyed by  inter-  in English; the Latin word meant merely of or to  exter- mination (cf.  intereo  perish,  intercido slay,  interimo  destroy)  without  imply- ing  the extermination of  both  parties. The  imported  notion, however, is what  gives  the word its only value, since  there  are plenty of substitutes for it in the  true  sense— destructive, slaughterous,  murderous, bloody, san- guinary,  mortal,  and so forth. The scholar  may therefore use or abstain from the word as he chooses, but it will be vain for him to  attempt  correct- ing  other  people's conception of the meaning, which for some seems to be little more than  intestine.

 p.p.,"This article  is  less severely  practical than most  in the book,  and is  addressed only  to  those few enthusiasts  who  find grammatical phenomena interesting apart from any rules  of  writing  that  may be  drawn from  them.  As  grammatical termino- logy  is far  from fixed  in  English,  it must  be  premised  that  p.p.  (past  par- ticiple)  is  here taken  as the  popular name  for the  single-word participle that  does  not end in  -ing,  i.e.,  by the p.p.  of  hear  is  meant  heard,  not  hearing nor  having heard  nor  being heard.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 All,"verbs,  with  negligible exceptions such as  must  and  can,  have this p.p., though in  many  it is  used only  as an  element in making compound parts like  has climbed  or  will have died.  That  function of  the p.p. is  familiar  to  everyone  and needs  no  comment.  Further,  the p.p. of  all transitive verbs can  be  used as  an adjective  (a  broken  jug).  What  is not so fully  realized  is the  part  played  by the adjectival  p.p. in  many intransitive verbs.  It is in the  first place  much commoner than  is  supposed. Most  of us,  perhaps, would  say  that  p.p. ad- jectives were  all  passive,  i.e.  were only  made from transitive verbs.  A moment's search  is  enough  to  correct that  notion— fallen  angels,  the  risen sun,  a  vanished hand, past times,  the newly arrived  guest,  a  grown  girl,  a  gone coon,  absconded  debtors,  escaped  prison- ers,  the  deceased  lady,  the dear  departed, a  collapsed  lorry,  we are  agreed,  a couched  lion,  an  eloped  pair,  an  expired lease. Secondly,  when  a  verb  is  both  transi- tive and intransitive,  it  is often  difficult to  say  whether  in  some particular phrase  the  p.p.  is  active  or  passive, and the answer may affect  the  sense; e.g., a  deserted  sailor,  if  deserted  is  passive, is  one who has been marooned,  but, if it is active,  is  one who has  run  from his ship;  an angel  dropped  from heaven",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 has,"possibly  been passive,  but  more likely active,  in the  descent;  a  capsized boat",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
intrigue,"may have capsized or have been  cap- sized;  a  failed B.A.  may  be one  whom the examiners have failed or one who has  failed to satisfy  them;  my declared enemy  is more often one who has de- clared enmity  than  one I have declared an enemy;  a flooded meadow  shows a passive  p.p.,  a  flooded river  perhaps an active one;  a  well  grown  tree  means one thing in the virgin forest, and another in a nursery garden. Thirdly, recognition of the frequency of  the intransitive p.p. will sometimes throw  light on expressions whose origin  is  otherwise  not  quite  obvious : a determined man  is perhaps one who has  determined, not been determined; a  person is  ://  advised  who has advised, i.e. taken  thought,  badly,  not  one who has  had bad advice given him; he is well  read  who  has  read well; he is  drunk who  has  drunk;  -spoken  in  soft-spoken etc.  is more intelligible if it is regarded as  active, and cf.  well-behaved; mis- taken clemency  seems to be clemency that  has  erred;  an aged man  may be one who  has  aged, since the verb a ge>  —  grow old, dates from before 1400;  the dissipated  may be those who have  wasted  their  substance, and  the experienced  those  having  experienced things  rather  than  those possessed of experience. intrigue, v. t.

The  other  chief dictionaries either ignore the sense or treat  it  contemptuously—English  dic- tionaries,  that  is, for it is naturally well enough known to the French; but it is one of the GALLICISMS, and LITERARY CRITICS'  WORDS,  that  have no  merit whatever  except  that  of unfamiliarity to the English reader, and at the same time  the great demerit of being identi- cal  with  and therefore  confusing  the sense  of a good English word.

The reader will not be surprised to learn  that,  since  the foregoing was written  in the nineteen-twenties, the resistance of the dictionaries has been stormed. The OED itself, in its  1933 Supp., gives copious examples of the use of  intrigue  in the sense  'to  excite the curiosity or interest of; to interest so  as to puzzle or fascinate', including one from the writings of a Cambridge Professor  of English Literature. The popularity  of the word is no  doubt  due partly to its novelty and partly to the better  reason  that  it can do something more  than  serve as a synonym for one of  the words listed above; it can con- vey  the meaning of two of  them  at once,  puzzle  and  fascinate  for instance.

The  work  stands still until  comes the convenient time  for  arranging  an amicable  rupture  of the old  engagement and  contracting  of the new. Comment: There is no  doubt  about the motive. It is a balance inversion, and one  that  would be justified by the great  length of the subject if the only place for the uninverted  comes  were at the end of the whole sentence. But what is too often forgotten in such cases  is  that  there  is usually a choice of  places for the verb; here  comes would be quite comfortable imme- diately  after  time. The conclusion suggested is  that,  so far  as relative clauses are concerned, especially  those containing  as,  the writer whose taste disposes him to use the natural uninverted order is at the very  least free to indulge it. INVERSIONS  OF THE  LITER- ARY  PARAGRAPHIST Those who provide newspapers  with short accounts of newly published books have an inversion form all to themselves. The principle seems to be to get the  title  of the book to a place where the reader can find it, and at the same  time to avoid the catalogue look that  results if the  title  is printed at the head before the description, and to give  a literary air to the paragraph. The  title  is therefore worked to the end, by the use of odd inversions  that",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
inversion,"editors would do well to prohibit. But, once broken in to inversion by this special  use of it, the minor literary critics  learn to love their chains, and it is among  them  that  the  false  ex- clamatory inversions dealt  with  in the next  section are most rife. Here,  mean- while, are some specimens: Most  racily written, with an easy con- versational  style about it, is Mr.  Frank Rutter's  'The  Path to  Paris'.  /  Diplo- matic and military are the  letters  that comprise  the  Correspondence  of  Lord Burghersh,  edited by his daughter-in- law.

Colonel Haggard's  latest  historical  study  [title]. FALSE  EXCLAMATORY INVERSION It has already been pointed out  that a  statement may be  turned  into an exclamation by inversion; an adjective or adverb  that  conveys emotion is put first out of its place, and inversion follows.  If Jacob had said  The days of  the years of my life have  been  few and evil,  he would have been stating a bald fact; by beginning  Few and evil have been,  he converts the statement into a  groan, and  gives  it poignancy. Writers who observe the poignancy sometimes given  by such inversion, but  fail  to ob- serve  that  'sometimes'  means 'when exclamation is appropriate', adopt in- version  as an infallible enlivener; they aim  at freshness and attain frigidity. In the following examples  there  is no emotional need of exclamation, and yet exclamatory inversion is the only  class to which they can be assigned:  Futile were  the endeavour to  trace  back to Pheidias'  varied  originals,  as we are tempted  to do, many of the later  statues,  j",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The  special effect  that  inver- sion  is  intended  to  secure  is an  empha- sis  of  some sort, and naturally emphasis is  more  often  suitable  to a  simple inde- pendent  sentence  than  to a  dependent clause.  Examples  are  grouped  under A,  B, and C,  according  to the  kind  of inversion  that  has  been  subordinated, and  comment  on  each group follows  : A. Negative Inversion.  The  amount involved  is  no less  a  sum  than  £300,000 per  annum,  to not a  penny  of  which have  the  drivers  a  shadow  of  claim.  /  To give  to all  the  scholars  that  firm ground- ing  upon  which  alone  can we  hope  to build an  educated  nation.  /  He  laid down four principles  on  which  alone could America  and  Austria go  further  in ex- changing  views.  / Now  that  not  only are public  executions  long extinct  in  this country,  but the  Press  not  admitted  to the majority  of  private ones,  the  hang- man has lost his vogue.  /  But it  had only been  established  that  on  eighteen  of those days  did he  vote.

inversion,"admitted  that,  while  to not a penny of this  etc.  (the independent forms) would require the inversion,  to not a penny of which  etc. (the subordinate forms) are at least as  good,  if not  better,  without it. The  fourth  example (executions) will on the  other  hand be upheld by many who have no inordinate liking for  inversion;  not only  is so little used except  in main sentences, and there- fore so associated  with  inversion,  that not  only  public  executions  are  long  extinct has  an unfamiliar sound even after Now  that.  It may moreover put the reader on a false scent by suggesting that  not only  qualifies  public  alone. The subordinate inversion in the last example is not  quite  what  it seems, being due to irresolution  between  an inverted and an uninverted form ; the former would be  But only on eighteen of  those  days  had it  been  established  that he  voted;  and the  latter,  But it had only been established that he voted on eighteen  of  those  days. B.  Exclamatory Inversion.  Suffice it to  say  that  in almost one-half of the rural district areas is  there  an admitted dearth  of  cottage  homes.  / Though once, at any rate, does  that  benign mistily golden  irony  of his weave  itself  in.f While for the first time, he believed, did naval and military history  appear as a  distinctive  feature.

Even  if main sentences had been used with  these  beginnings,  they should have been put as statements, i.e.  without inversion, and still more  when  they depend on  Though  and  Suffice it to say that.

Comment:  About  these  there  can hardly be a difference of opinion.

INVERSION  IN PARALLEL CLAUSES As  with  combinations of a negative and a positive  statement  into one (see NEGATIVE  MISHANDLING 2), so  with  in- verted and uninverted members of a sentence care is very necessary. Not only is it  so necessarily bounded by that moving  veil  zohich  ever hides the future,  but also is it  unable to penetrate .  . .  into . . . the past (but also is it  is an impossible inversion, brought  about by  the  correct one  that  precedes). / Not only  in equipment but in the  personnel of  the Air  Battaliojx  are we  suffering from  maladministration (Not only in equipment  requires  are we suffering; in the  personnel  requires  we are suffering.

INVERSION IN DIALOGUE MACHINERY Novelists and others who have to use dialogue  as an ingredient in narrative are some of  them  unduly worried by the machinery problem. Tired of  writ- ing  down  he said  and  said he  and  she replied  as often as they must, they mis- takenly suppose the good old forms to be as tiring to their readers as to  them- selves,  and seek relief in whimsical variations.  The fact is  that  readers care much  what  is said, but little about the frame into which a remark or a speech is  fitted  ;  or rather, the virtue of frames is  not  that  they should be various, but that  they should be inconspicuous. It is  true  that  an absolutely unrelieved monotony will itself become con- spicuous; but the variety necessary to obviate  that  should be strictly limited to forms inconspicuous in themselves. Among those  that  are not inconspi- cuous, and are therefore bad, are many developments of the blameless and inconspicuous  said he,  especially the substitution of verbs  that  are only by much stretching qualified for verbs of saying,  and  again  the use of those parts of  verbs of  saying  that  include auxilia- ries.  Most of the following examples exhibit a writer trying not to bore his reader; nothing bores so fatally as an open consciousness  that  one is in danger  of boring, and a sure  sign  of this is the very tiresome mannerism initiated perhaps by Meredith  {'Ah' fluted  Fenellan),  and now staled by imitation:   ''Hand  on  heart}'   she doubted,  j  'Need  any  help?'  husked A.  / '  They're our best revenue' defended B.  / '/  know his  kind'  fondly  remembered  C.  j 'Why  shouldn't he?'  scorned  D.  / 'Yes',   moodily  consented  John,   'I suppose  we must'.  /  'Oh?'  questioned he.  I  'Oh,  what a  sigh!',  marvelled Annunziata.  /  'But   then', puzzled John,  'what is it that  people  mean when they talk about death?'  /  'The  sordid sort  of existence', augmented  John.  / '  You misunderstand your instructions', murmured  rapidly Mr.  Travers. \ '/  couldn't help liking the chap',  would shout  Lingard when telling the  story.  /  'I won't  plot anything extra  against  Tom\ had said  Isaac.  I'At  any rate,  then',  may rejoin  our  critic,  'it is clearly  useless. ..'/ The  ordinary  'said he' etc.  (Thou  art right, Trim, in  both  cases,  said my uncle Toby) was described above as blameless  and inconspicuous. Its place among inversions is in the  'signpost' class.  The reader is to be given the theme  (i.e., here, the speech) at the earliest  possible  moment;  the speech, being grammatically the object of 'said',  yet placed first, draws 'said' to it, and 'he', or my uncle Toby, has to wait. But only such insignificant verbs as  said, replied, continued,  will submit to being dragged about like this; we must  treat  with  greater respect verbs that  introduce a more complicated notion, or  that  are weighted  with auxiliaries  or adverbs (compare  'went on my uncle Toby'  with  'continued my uncle Toby'), or  that  cannot rightly take a speech as object. These stand on their dignity and insist on their proper place. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say  that  they used to do so. The fashion of introducing quotations by inversions set by the more sprightly American periodicals has  led to a riot of inversion in popular journalism of the kind parodied by P.  G.  Wodehouse  in  'Where  it will all end knows God, as  Time  magazine would say'. See  also  SAID.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

inwardness.,"The  i.,  the real i., the true  i., of  something has a meaning that  it would not occur to us to give it out of our own heads, but  that  we some  time  or  other  discover to be at- tached to it by  other  people, especially such as  write  books.  That  meaning is, as  defined by the OED, 'the inward or intrinsic character or quality of a thing ; the  inner nature, essence, or meaning'. It is a literary phrase fit for a literary man to use when he is writing for or talking to literary people, but  other- wise pretentious.  True  wisdom is to abstain from it till it seems the really natural  phrase;  and any inclination to put inverted commas round it is a fair proof  that  one has not reached, or  that one doubts  whether  one's readers have reached, the stage of so regarding it. There is a certain intrusiveness  about the word in these quotations  ;  omission, or a simpler substitute, would have done no harm:  When  the  First  Lord gets  to understand (the real i. of) the present  situation, I have every confi- dence  that he will do full justice to the Thames.  /  In this connexion I would warn  readers  who are  unacquainted  with (the  i. of) South African affairs not to attach undue importance to a  recent declaration,  j  Will  you allow me to send a  few lines on the true i. of the situation?

 -ment.,"Many verbs have associated  with  them  nouns of  both forms, as commit,  commission  and  com- mitment',  require,  requisition  and  re- quirement;  excite,  excitement  and  excita- tion.  When  both  are well established, as in these  cases,  the two nouns usually coexist because  they  have come by DIFFERENTIATION  to  divide the possible meanings  between  them  and so  tend to lucidity. How little the essential difference of meaning is in the two terminations may be seen by compar- ing  emendation  with  amendment  (where the first means rather correction made, and the second rather correcting), and requisition  with  requirement  (where  the first means rather requiring, and the second rather thing required), and then  noticing  that  the two compari- sons  give more or  less  contrary results. Further, when  there  is only one estab- lished  form, it is not apparent to the layman,  though the philologist some- times knows, why one form exists and the  other  does  not—why  for instance we say  infliction  and not  inflictment, but  punishment  and not  punition.  The conclusion is  that  usage should be respected, and  less  usual forms such as  abolishment  and  admonishment,  or rare ones such as  incitation,  and punition,  should not be resorted to when  abolition,  admonition, incitement, and  punishment,  are to hand.

I.Q.,"from  that  discussed in the preceding article in several respects. First,  -ness words can be made from any adjective or participle, whereas the formation of -ment  words from verbs is by no means unrestricted ; by the side of  persuasion you can make  persuasiveness,  but not persuadement.  Secondly,  there  is more possibility  of a clear distinction in meaning;  -ion  and  -ment  are  both attached to verbs, so  that  neither has any  more claim than the other to repre- sent the verbal idea of action. But between  -ion  and  -ness  that  line does exist; though  -ion  and  -ness  are often appended to exactly the same form, as in  abjectness  and  abjection,  one is made from the English adjective  abject,  and the other from the Latin verbal stem abject-,  with  the consequence  that abjectness  necessarily represents a state or quality, and  abjection  naturally a process or action. Thirdly, while  both -ion  and  -ment  pass  easily  from the idea  of a process or action into  that of  the  product— abstraction  for in- stance being equivalent either to abstracting or to abstract  notion—,  to subject  -ness  to  that  treatment  is to do it violence; we can call virtue an abstraction, but not an abstractness. In compensation for this disability, the  -ness  words should be guaranteed as  far as possible the exclusive right to the meaning of state or quality; e.g. we should avoid talking of the abstraction  or the  concision  of a writer's style,  or of the  consideration  that marks someone's dealings, when we mean abstractness, conciseness, and considerateness.  Concision  means the process of cutting down, and  concise- ness  the cut-down state; the ordinary man, who when he means the latter says  conciseness,  shows more literary sense  than the literary critic, who  says concision  just because the French (who have not the advantage of possessing -ness)  have to say it, and he likes  galli- cizing.  It is not always  easy  to prove that  writers do not mean the process rather than the quality, but appear- ances  are often against  them.  In the following  examples, if the epithets short-winded  in the first  and  pungency  in the second are taken into account, it is pretty  clear  that  the quality of  the  style was  meant in  both,  and  conciseness would have been the right word: / really  think any Muse {when she is neither  resting  nor flying) ought to tighten  her  girdle,  tuck up her skirts, and step out. It is better than Tenny- son's  short-winded and artificial con- cision — but  there  is such a thing as swift and  spontaneous  style.  /  But then as a writer  of  letters,  diaries, and memo- randa, Mr. Gladstone did not shine by any habitual  concision  or pungency of style.  If it were not for this frequent uncertainty about  what  is really meant, it would be as bad to say  concision  for conciseness  as to use  correction  (which, like  concision,  could be defended as a Gallicism)  for  correctness,  or  indirec- tion  (for which  Hamlet  n. i. 66 might be pleaded) for  indirectness. Simple reference of any word in  -ion to this article may be taken to mean that  there  is a tendency for it to usurp the functions of the noun in  -ness.  See also  -TY and  -NESS. I.Q. (Intelligence Quotient), a measure of  mental capacity applied especially to children and mental defectives, is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) that  the 'mental age' of the subject of the  test  (i.e. the age at which the same mental capacity would be found in a normal person) bears to his actual age. Thus the I.Q. of a clever child of 6 with  a mental age of 9 would be  150. As the qualities tested are such as ordinarily  mature at  15,  that  figure is taken instead of actual age for all older persons.  Thus the I.Q. of an adult mental defective  with  a mental age of nine would be 60 (900  -M5).  Psycho- logists  make the following gradation of mental capacity expressed in terms of I.Q.:  Very  superior  130  plus,  superior 120/129,  bright  average  110/119,  aver- age  90/109,  dull  average  80/89,  border- line  jo  I  jg,  feeble-minded  50/69,  imbecile 25/49,  idiot  24 minus.

irony,"another party  that,  when more is meant than meets the ear, is aware both  of  that  more and of the outsiders' incomprehension. 1.  Socratic  irony  was a profession of ignorance.  What  Socrates represented as  an ignorance and a weakness in himself  was in fact a non-committal attitude  towards any dogma, however accepted or imposing,  that  had not been carried back to and shown to be based upon first principles. The two parties in his audience were, first,  the dogmatists moved by pity or  contempt  to enlighten this  igno- rance,  and secondly, those who knew their Socrates and set themselves to watch the familiar game in which learning  should be  turned  inside out by  simplicity. 2.  The double audience is essential also  to what is called  dramatic irony, i.e.  the irony of the Greek drama. That  drama had the peculiarity of providing the double  audience—one party in the secret and the other  not— in  a special manner. The facts of most Greek plays were not a  matter  for invention, but were  part  of every Athenian child's store of legend; all the spectators,  that  is, were in the secret beforehand of what would hap- pen. But the characters, Pentheus and Oedipus and the rest, were in the  dark  ; one of  them  might  utter  words  that  to him and his companions on the stage were of trifling  import,  but to those who hearing could understand were pregnant  with  the coming doom.

That is an  attempt  to link intelligibly together three special senses of the word  irony ,  which in its more general sense  may be  defined  as the use of words intended to convey one meaning to the uninitiated part of the audience and  another to the initiated, the delight of  it  lying  in the secret intimacy set up between the latter and the speaker. It should  be added, however,  that  there are  dealers in irony for whom the initiated circle is not of outside hearers, but is an  alter ego  dwelling in their own breasts. For  practical purposes a protest is needed  against  the application of  'the irony  of Fate', or of  'irony'  for short, to every trivial oddity:  But the  pleasant note  changed  to  something  almost bitter as he  declared  his fear that  before  them lay a  'fight  for everything we  hold  dear' — a  sentence  that the  groundlings  by  a curious  irony  were  the  loudest  in  cheering (oddly  enough). /  'The  irony of the thing'  said the dairyman who now owns the  business  'lies  in the fact that after I began  to  sell  good  wholesome  butter in place  of this adulterated mixture, my sales  fell off  7$  P er  cent.'

There is in- deed a certain charm in the grown-up man's  boyish ebullience, not to be re- strained  by thoughts of relevance from letting the exuberant phrase jet forth. And for  that  charm we put up  with  it when one draws our attention to the methodical by telling us there is  method in the  madness,  though method and not madness  is all there is to see, when another's every winter is  the winter of his  discontent,  when a third cannot complain of the  light  without  calling it  religious  as well as  dim,  when for a  fourth nothing can be  rotten  except  in the  state of Denmark,  when a fifth, dressed  after bathing, tells you  that  he is  clothed  and in his  right  mind,  or when a  sixth, asked whether he does not owe you  45.  6d.  for  that  cab fare,  owns  the soft  impeachment.

The straightforward meaning and the ironi- cal  are  both  good; anything between them,  in which the real meaning is merely to leave alone, and  severely  is no more than an echo, is pointless and vapid and in  print  intolerable.

Before we  know  whether  is  or  are  is required, then, we must decide whether  six  is a  singular noun, the name of a quantity, or a plural adjective agreeing  with a  suppressed  noun;  does it mean 'the quantity six', or does it mean 'six things'  ?  That question each of us can answer,  perhaps, for himself, but no one for other people; it is therefore equally  correct to say  twice two is  four and  twice two are four.  Moreover, as the two are equally correct, so they appear (OED,  s.v.  time) to be about equally  old  ;  four times six  was plural as  long ago as  1380,  and  ten times two was  singular in  1425. 3.

A correspondent writes to a newspaper : 'Sir,—Why  do I see today, in a cele- brated morning contemporary, the following  sentence: ""The trouble  is nothing to do  with  education"" (Italics mine)?'  The facts are, first,  that  has nothing  to do with  requires no defence, secondly,  that  is  nothing to do with  is said  by many to be indefensible, and, thirdly,  that  is  nothing to do with  is nevertheless very common, perhaps far  commoner than the other.  When a  form of speech  that  one regards as a  corruption  gains  wide currency, the question whether one should  tilt  at it is  not quite simple. If it is an obvious outrage on grammar, yes; if, on the other hand, its wrongness is of the kind  that  has to be pointed out before it is noticed, and its hold on the public strong  enough to take a good deal of loosening,  then perhaps it is  better  to buttress it up than to  tilt  at it. Here, then, is an  attempt  to justify  is. Most of us, when we have occasion to repel an impertinent question, and are not in the mood for weighing words in the  scales  of grammar, feel  that  That is nothing to do with you  expresses our feelings  better  than  That  has  etc. ;  that is  to say, the instinctive word is  is,  not has.  But,  says  the champion of gram- mar, instinctive or not, it is a mere wrong mixture of two right ways of saying  the thing:  That  is nothing to you,  and  That  has nothing to do with you.  He is very likely right, but it is not quite so certain as he thinks; and the popular phrase  that  is on its trial for  impropriety should always be given the benefit of the  doubt  if there is one. Now it does not seem impossible  that It is nothing to do with  may have arisen from sentences in which  to do  has ac- quired the status of an adjective mean- ing  concerned or connected ; such sen- tences would be :  There is nothing to do with  prisons  that he cannot  tell  you.  /  l A Wife's  Secret"" 1  (nothing  to do with the  old play of that name).  /  Anything to do with spiritualism is  interesting.  In the first  of  those  nothing to do  means not a  single  thing  concerned,  nothing  being a  noun; and in the second it means not at all connected,  nothing  being an ad- verb.  No  doubt  this use of  to do  is elliptical  for  having to  do  ; but the point is  that  it  gives  us a different construc- tion for  nothing  (or any corresponding word) which here is not the object of",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
-ise,"the  omitted  having,  as it is of  has  in  It has nothing to do  with,  but is  either  the noun  with  which  the  supposed  having agrees  or an  adverb negativing  it. On this theory, the two forms may be para- phrased  thus  :  It  has nothing  to  do with you  =  It has  no function  to  perform with  you;  and  It is  nothing  to do  with you  =  It  is  not  amatter  concernedLwith you.  The  first  is  simpler  to  arrive  at than  the  second,  but the  second  is not impossible.  The  precisian  who  likes an  easily  analysable sentence, and  the natural man who likes  to  say  the  thing that  springs  to his  lips,  had  better agree  to  live and  let  live ; and they will do this  the  more readily  if  the first  can believe  that  the two  ways  of  putting the thing differ  not  only  in the  visible distinction  between  has  and  is,  but  also in  the  invisible  one  between  two or more constructions  of  nothing.  It  may fairly  be  maintained  that  there  are three  right ways  of  saying  the  thing: It is nothing to you;  It  has nothing to do ivith  you;  It is  nothing  to  do with you: instead of two right ways and  a  wrong. And  if  the speaker is excited, as  he  well may  be, we  shall  be  unlikely  to  know which  of the  last  two he has  chosen; for he will say  it's.

The OED's judgement may be quoted: 'In modern French the suffix has  become  -iser,  alike in words from Greek, as  baptiser, évangéliser,  organ- iser,  and  those  formed after  them  from Latin,  as  civiliser,  cicatriser,  humaniser. Hence, some have used the spelling -ise  in  English,  as in French, for all these words, and some prefer  -ise  in words formed in French or  English from Latin elements, retaining  -ize  for those of Greek composition. But the suffix  itself, whatever the element to which  it  is added, is in its origin the Greek  -izein,  Latin  -izare;  and, as the pronunciation is  also  with  z,  there  is no reason why in  English  the special French spelling should be followed, in opposition to  that  which is at once etymological  and phonetic'.

The etymo- logies,  several of which are indeed unknown, do not  throw  much light, but may be given for what they are worth:  dialect  and  idiom  are Greek (SiaXeyofiai  I talk;  ÏBios  private or proper or peculiar) ;  cant  and  vernacu- lar  are Latin  (cantus  song, chant, whine;  verna  homeborn  slave);  lingo is  Italian (probably a corruption of lingua  franca) ;  argot,  jargon,  parlance and  patois  are French;  gibberish  and shop  and  slang  are  English,  the first probably an imitation of the sound meant, the second a particular applica- tion of the common word, and the third of unknown origin. argot  is primarily the vocabulary of thieves  and  tramps in France, serving to veil their meaning, and is applied secondarily  to the special vocabulary of  any set of persons. There is in these senses  no justification for its applica- tion to any  English  manner of speech instead of whichever  English  word may  be most appropriate. cant  in current  English  means the insincere  or parrotlike appeal to prin- ciples,  religious, moral, political, or scientific,  that  the speaker does not",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

jargon,"believe in or act upon, or does not understand. It is best to restrict it to this definite use; but its earlier  sense— special  vocabulary of the disreputable —survives  in the expression  thieves' cant.  As a general  term  for the special vocabulary  of an art, profession, sport, etc.  it has been superseded by  jargon, lingo,  and  slang. dialect  is essentially local;  a d.  is the variety  of a language  that  prevails in a  district,  with  local peculiarities of vocabulary,  pronunciation, and phrase. gibberish  is the name for unintelligible stuff: applied by exaggeration to a language  unknown to the hearer (for which, however,  lingo  is more usual), and to anything either too learnedly worded, or on the other hand too rudely expressed, for him to make out its meaning. idiom  is the method of expression characteristic of or peculiar to the native speakers of a  language;  i.e. it is racy  or unaffected or natural  English (or French etc.), especially so far as that  happens not to coincide  with  the method of expression prevalent in other  languages;  and  an i.  is a par- ticular example of such speech. An earlier  sense, the same as  that  of dialect,  still occurs sometimes. See also  IDIOM. jargon  is talk  that  is considered  both ugly-sounding  and hard to under- stand: applied especially to  (1)  the sectional  vocabulary of a science, art, class,  sect, trade, or profession, full of technical terms (cf.  lingo,  slang);  (2) hybrid speech of different  languages; (3)  loosely the use of long words, circumlocution, and other clumsiness. It would be well if  jargon  could be confined to the first sense. There is plenty of  work  for it  there  alone, so copiously  does jargon of this sort breed nowadays,  especially in the newer sciences  such as psychology and socio- logy,  and so readily does it escape from its proper sphere to produce  POPU- LARIZED  TECHNICALITIES—words  that cloud the minds alike of those who use them  and those who read  them.  It is a  pity  that  the edge  of  jargon's  meaning has  been blunted by its being used in",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
jargon,"sense  (3); and  attempts  have been made to relieve it  of  the duty by inventing another word for  that  style of  writing, as Ivor Brown invented barnacular,  gargantuan,  and  pudder  in England  and Maury Maverick  gobble- dygook  in America. But these have made little headway;  jargon  remains for  most people the pejorative name for  the style of writing of which the civil  service is rather unfairly sup- posed to be the chief exponent.

 SOCIOLOGESE.,"lingo  is a contemptuous name for any foreign  language (/  can't  speak their beastly  lingo).  It is sometimes used, like  jargon  (1),  for a sectional vocabu- lary. lingua  franca  is a  mixture  of lan- guages  (Italian, French, Greek, and Spanish)  used by traders in the Levant; and, by extension, any lan- guage,  or linguistic mixture,  that serves  as a medium of communication between different peoples. parlance,  which means manner of speaking,  has the peculiarity of posses- sing  no significance of its own and being never used by itself. You can say That  is dialect,  That  is  slang,  etc., but not  That  is parlance;  parlance  is al- ways  accompanied by an adjective or denning  word or phrase, and  that  ad- jective, not  parlance,  gives  the  point  : in  golfing  or  nautical parlance, in the parlance  of the literary  critics,  etc. patois,  as used in  English,  means nothing different from  dialect,  and, like  argot,  is not used about England. The French distinguish two  stages: dialects  exist until a common literary language  is evolved from  them,  after which, if they still linger, they become patois; but in English we let  them retain their title. shop  describes business talk indulged in out of business hours, or any un- seasonable  technical phraseology, and is  thus  distinct, in the special-vocabu- lary  sense,  from  jargon  and  slang. slang  is the diction  that  results from the favourite game among the young 316",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

jazz,"and lively of playing  with  words and renaming things and actions; some invent new words, or mutilate or misapply the old, for the pleasure of novelty, and others catch up such words for the pleasure of being in the fashion.  Many slang words and phrases perish, a few establish themselves; in either  case,  during probation they are accounted  unfit  for literary use.  «S.  is also  used in the sense  of  jargon  (1),  but with  two distinctions: in general it expresses  less  dislike and imputation of  ugliness than  jargon;  and it is naturally commoner about sporting vocabularies  (golf  s.  etc.) than  jargon, because many of the terms used in sports are slang in the main sense  also. Backslang  is a puerile type, consisting merely in pronouncing words back- wards,  e.g.  ynnep  for  penny  and  cool for  look.

jazz,"is  primarily  the name given to a  type  of dance music  of  American negro origin  that  first became widely known at the beginning of the 20th c. and is now popular all over the world. As a musical  term  it has resisted all  attempts at exact definition ; all  that  can be said is  that  in its most characteristic form it is  in common  time  with  a pizzicato bass  in crotchets to offset a syncopated solo,  often improvised. Or, as Sir Kenneth Clark has put it more pic- turesquely, comparing jazz  with  'ac- tion' painting, 'The  trumpeter  rises from his seat as one possessed and",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
jejune,"squirts  out his  melody like  a  scarlet scrawl against  a  background  of  plan- gent dashes  and  dots'. Jazz  has  been classified  into  fractional),  mainstream, and  modern,  but  these distinctions  are chronological  rather than stylistic.  It would  be  outside  the  scope  of  this dictionary  to  trace  its  stylistic develop- ment,  marked  by a  series  of  engaging designations  such  as  Ragtime, Swing, Jam,  Boogie-Woogie,  and  Bebop;  the curious should consult  The  Oxford Companion  to  Music. The derivation  of the  word  is un- known,  and has  been  the  subject  of almost  as  much  speculation  as  that  of O.K.Çq.v.).  Early alternative spellings wetejas  and  jass,  and one  theory attri- butes  it,  improbably,  to the  French jaser  meaning babble, another  to an early  player  or  conductor called Jas., or Jasbo Brown, another  to an old minstrel-show word  jasbo  for a  turn that  could  be  relied  on to  please  an audience when  all  else  was  failing. According  to  another,  the  word  origin- ally  had an  obscene connotation  in American  slang,  and  when  it was ap- plied  by a  newspaper  as a  term  of abuse  to the  first band  of  the kind  that visited Chicago,  it was  adopted  by them  as a  label likely  to  assure good attendances. The word  has  now  strayed outside the confines  of  music,  and is  freely used  to  describe  any  kind  of  restless gaiety  and  garish colouring.  It  has  an adjective,  jazzy,  but the  noun used attributively is more common and may be applied  to  anything from language to stockings.  It is  also  a  verb,  both intransitive  ('to  move  in a  grotesque  or fantastic  fashion'—OED  Supp.)  and transitive, usually  with  up,  sometimes in its musical sense  (jazz up the  classics), sometimes figuratively  of  enlivening a  person or thing.  Thus  jazz,  in  both  its primary and  its  transferred senses,  has suffered  the  fate common  to all  VOGUE WORDS  of  losing  any precision  of  mean- ing  it  may once have  had.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

" jocular,","etc.  These  and several  other  words— arch,  facetious, flippant,  jesting,  merry,  and  waggish — are difficult to separate from each other;  the dictionaries establish no very  clear or serviceable distinctions, tending to explain each by a selection of  the rest. They are marked off from funny, droll,  and others, by the fact that  in the latter the effect, but in these the  intent,  is the main  point;  that  is funny etc. which amuses, but  that  is jocular  etc. which is meant (or, if a person, means) to amuse. In the fol- lowing remarks no definition of the whole meaning of any word is at- tempted;  attention is drawn merely to the points of difference between the one in question and some or all of the others.

There are some who would differentiate by  using  judgment for the judicial pronouncement and judgement  for all  other  purposes. This may be too subtle for popular taste, but authority for some such distinc- tion can be  found  in the rules of the OUP, which favours  judgment  in  legal works and  judgement  in all others. judicial,  judicious. The first has to do  with  judges and  lawcourts  and  legal judgements, the second  with  the men- tal  faculty  of judgement,  that  is to say, if  the distinction mentioned at the end of  the preceding article were to prevail, the first  with  judgment and the sec- ond  with  judgement.  Judicial murder is  murder  perpetrated  by means of a  legal  trial;  judicious  murder  is murder that  is well calculated to serve the murderer's interests. The distinction is  clear enough,  except  that  judicial  has one use  that  brings it near  judicious; this use is impartial or such as might be  expected  of a judge or a lawcourt, applied to such words as  view, conduct, care,  investigation,  to  which  judicious  is also  applicable in the sense of wise or sagacious  or  prudent.

He has proved right. Five years later the word was accorded unassailable status when the House of Lords decided  that know-how is 'an ambience pervading a  highly specialized production or- ganization'  and is properly treated as one of its capital assets  (Rolls  Royce Ltd.v. Inland Revenue  Commissioners). 'Know-how'  said  the Master of the Rolls  in a later revenue  case  'has a meaning  as well recognized  as  goodwill'.

 phrases.,"'The  reformed  pro- nunciation  of  Latin',  wrote  R. W. Chapman, 'has caused great confusion in  the  pronunciation  of  Latin words that  have been adopted  in  English. The main differences  are  these  : 1.  Short vowels, whether stressed  or not,  are  unaffected. 2.  The  long vowels  : Stressed  §,  formerly  as in  mate, now  as in  ah. Stressed  ë,  formerly  as in  mete, now  as in  mate. Stressed  î,  formerly  as in  mite, now  as in  mete. 3.  U,  stressed  or  not, was formerly  as in  must  (Sulla)  or as in  mute (Punica  fides).  It is  now  as in  bull or  moot. 'The  safe  course  is  ""stare super antiquas  vias"".  If  we impose  the new Latin  on  English,  consistency will demand  that  we say  bonus  and  minus and  Romulus  and  Rëmus  and a  thou- sand  other horrors.  But in  fact many people, unaware  of the  trap,  do say wahdi  maycoom,  O  see  sick  omnays  and the like. 'The consonants  give  little trouble.

For  the  pronunciations recommended for  an  English-speaking  person see  the separate entries.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 plurals,"(or  latinized-Greek). Of  most words  in  fairly  common  use that  have  a  Latin  as  well  as or  instead of  an  English  plural  the  correct Latin form  is  given  in the  word's alpha- betical place.  A few  general remarks may  be  made here. 1.  No rule can  be  given for preferring or avoiding  the  Latin form. Some words invariably  use it;  nobody  says specieses,  thesises,  or  basises,  instead  of the Latin  species,  theses,  and  bases {basez).  Others nearly always have the Latin form,  but  occasionally  the English  ;  bacilluses,  lacunas,  andgenuses, are  used  at  least  by  anti-Latin fanatics instead  of  bacilli,  lacunae,  and  genera. More often  the  Latin  and  English forms  are on  fairly  equal terms,  con- text  or individual taste deciding for one or  the  other;  formulas, indexes,  narcis- suses,  miasmas,  nimbuses,  and  vortexes, are  fitter  for  popular writing, while scientific  treatises tend  to  formulae, indices,  miasmata,  narcissi,  nimbi,  and vortices.  Sometimes  the  two forms  are utilized  for  real  differentiation,  as when  genii  means spirits, and  geniuses men. All  that  can  safely  be  said  is  that there  is a  tendency  to  abandon  the Latin  plurals,  and  that,  when  one is really  in  doubt  which  to  use,  the  Eng- lish  form should  be  given  the pre- ference. 2.  With  a few  exceptions  too  firmly rooted  to be  dislodged (e.g.  Adelphi), Latin  plurals  in  -i  should  be pro- 325 -latry nounced distinctly  -f,  and  not  -ë  or  -1 like  the  Italian  dilettanti,  pococuranti t etc.;  the  reformed pronunciation  of Latin  does  not  obtain  in  naturalized Latin  words  (see  LATIN  PHRASES),  and to  say  glâ'dïôlë  reveals  that  one is ignorant  either  that  the  word  is  Latin or  how  Latin words  are  pronounced. Plurals  of  words  in  -is  {theses,  meta- morphoses,  neuroses)  should  be  plainly pronounced  ~ëz,  not  -ïz  like  English plurals. 3.  In  Latin plurals  there  are naturally some  traps  for  non-Latinists  ; the termination  of the  singular  is no  sure guide  to  that  of the  plural. Most Latin  words  in  -us  have plural  in  -*', but  not  all;  and so  zeal  not  according to knowledge  issues  in  such oddities  as hiati,  octopi,  omnibi,  and  ignorami.  See -us.  Similarly  most Latin nouns  in  -a have  plural  in  -ae,  but not  all :  lacuna, -nae;  but  dogma  and  gumma,  -mata; Saturnalia,  not  singular  but  plural. Animalcula  is the plural  oianimalculum, but  is  sometimes treated  as a  singular (=  animalcule),  with  plural  animal- culae.  And,  though  -us  and  -a  are much  the  commonest Anglo-Latin endings,  the  same danger attends some  others  {-ex, -er, -o,  etc.). 4.  The  treatment  of a  Latin noun  as an  English  plural because  it  ends  in -5  is  surprising when of modern intro- duction.  The  Latin plural  of  for- ceps  is  forcipes,  and  the  English  plural should  be  forcepses  ;  a  forceps,  a  set  of forcipes  or  forcepses  ;  and  both  these were  formerly  in  use.  But  shears  and scissors  and  pincers  and  pliers  have  so convinced  us  that  no  such word  can have  a  singular  that  instead  of  a  forceps we usually  say  a  pair  of  forceps,  and forceps  has to  serve  for  both  singular and  plural.

latter,"survives  almost solely in  the I.,  which provides  with  the former  a pair of pronouns obviating disagree- able repetition of  one  or  both  of a pair of  previously mentioned names or nouns. Such avoidance of repetition is  often desirable; for the principles, See  ELEGANT VARIATION,  and  REPETI- TION.  But  the  I.  is liable to certain special  misuses:  (1)  The  I.  should not be used when more than a pair are in question, as in :  The difficult  problems involved  in the early association of Thomas Girtin, Rooker, Dayes, and Turner are well illustrated by a set of drawings  that . . .; and what was un- doubtedly  the best  period  of  the 1. artist is splendidly demonstrated by.  . . . (2) Neither  should it be used when fewer than two are in question; the public and its shillings cannot be reasonably iegarded  as  a  pair of things on the same footing in :  The mass of the pic- ture-loving  public,  however,  may be assured  of  good  value for the  shillings — whatever  be the ultimate destination of the  1.  (3) The  true  elegant-variationist, who of course works  the  I.  very hard, should observe  that  a mere pronoun will not do for the antecedent of  the  /., even though  there  may  be a name in the background; a  writer  who varies Gordon  with  the  hero  of Khartoum  and his relative  naturally does not shrink from picking up  him  with  the  /.; it is all  of a piece, and a bad piece:  Mr. Hake was a cousin of the late General Gordon,  of whom he entertained a most affectionate  remembrance.  On one  occa- sion,  when the  hero  of Khartoum was dining with  him, the 1.  invited his rela- tive  to  take  wine  with him, but Gordon imperiously  declined.  (4) The  true  use of  it is not to mystify, as in :  The only people  to gain  will  he the Tories and the principal  losers  will he the  working-class voters  whose interests the  Labour  Party is  supposed  to have at heart. It is a very poor  compliment to the intelligence of the 1.

laughter.,"Homeric  I.  is a now com- mon phrase whose meaning  must  be vague  to many readers. It is especially the laugh  that  runs round a circle of spectators when a ludicrous or  other- wise pleasing incident surprises  them. In Olympus, when Zeus and Hera have had words, the limping Hephae- stus counsels his  mother  to deal in soft answers.  When  he, in  that  former quarrel, had tried to  protect  her, had he not been  flung  forth and fallen nine days  through air till he landed in Lemnos?  And were not nectar and ambrosia in Olympian halls  better than such doings? And  therewith  he hastened round and filled the cups of all  the  gods;  'and inextinguishable was the laughter of the blessed gods as they watched Hephaestus bustling about  the hall'. And  again,  when Penelope's suitors set the beggar bully  Irus  to box  with the seeming beggar Odysseus,  'then the twain put up their hands, and Irus struck at the right shoulder, but the other  smote him on his neck beneath the ear, and crushed in the bones, and straightway the red blood gushed up through his  mouth,  and  with  a moan he fell in the dust, and drave together his  teeth  as he kicked the ground. But the  proud  wooers  threw  up their hands,  and died outright for laughter'. Such is Homeric 1.; but  whether  the frequent use of the phrase is justified by present-day familiarity  with  Homer is  doubtful.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

A plain example or two will show the point:  The inhabitants of the inde- pendent  lands greatly desire our direct government, which government  has, however,  for years refused to take any strong  measures.  /  Although he was a very  painstaking and industrious pupil, he never indicated any signs of  develop- ing  into  the great naval genius by which his name will in future be  distinguished.  / Mark had now got his first  taste of print,  and he liked it, and  it was a taste that was to show  many  developments.

In the second,  genius  means a singu- larly  able person, but  which,  its deputy,  means singular ability.

Interest  is peculiarly liable to maltreatment :  Vis- count  Grey's  promised  speech  in the House  of Lords on Reparations and inter-Allied  debts  furnished  all the interest  naturally  aroused.  Interest  is here virtually, though not actually, used  twice—the  speech furnished interest, interest was aroused; but what  was furnished was interesting matter,  and  what  was aroused was eager  curiosity;  interest  can bear either sense,  but not  both  in one sentence. / For  while  the Opposition beat their drums as loudly as ever, it was well known that  there  was very little behind all this fuss, and that  in the very interests  which they so furiously pro- tected  they  were  anxious to meet the Government  half-way.

I  A lesser prize  will  probably  be offered  which will be  confined  to  British manufacturers.  These extracts suggest ignorance  of, or indifference to, modern idiomatic restrictions on the use of  less  and  lesser.  The grammar of both  is correct ; but, when the  context —unemotional  statement  of everyday facts—is  taken into account,  at a less price  ought to be  at a  lower  price,  and a  lesser  prize  ought to be  a smaller prize.  It is  true  that  less  and  lesser  were once ordinary comparatives of  little (lesser  differing from  less  in being used only as an adjective and only before a noun), and  that  therefore they were roughly equivalent in sense to our  smaller,  also  that  this piece of archaism,  like many others, is per- missible  in emotional  passages  or such as demand exceptionally digni- fied  expression. But the extracts have no such qualification. The  modern  tendency is so to restrict less  that  it means not  smaller,  but  a smaller  amount of;  it is the comparative rather of  a little  than of  little,  and is consequently applied only to things that  are measured by amount and not by  size or quality or  number,  to nouns with  which  much  and  little,  not  great and  small,  nor  high  and  low,  nor  many and  few,  are the appropriate con- trasted epithets.

•less.,"The original and normal use of this suffix is to append it to nouns, so producing adjectives meaning  without the thing, e.g.  headless,  tuneless;  to this use  there are no limits whatever. Words made from verbs,  with  the sense  not able to do or not liable to suffer  the action or process, as  tireless and  fadeless,  are  much fewer, are mostly  of a poetical cast, and when new-minted strike the reader, at least of  prose, as base metal.  They  have  an undeniable advantage in their short- ness  (compare  resistless  and  fadeless, with  irresistible  and  unfadable),  but this is outweighed for all except fully established  ones by the uneasy feeling that  there is something queer about them. Apart from a few so familiar that  no  thought of their elements and formation occurs to us, such as  daunt- less,  -less  words made from verbs are much  better  left to the poets. This does  not apply to the many in which, as  in  numberless,  formation from the noun  gives  the  sense  as well, if not as obviously,  as formation from the verb (without  number? or not able to be numbered?);  dauntless  itself may per- haps have been made from the noun daunt,  which in the  15th  and  16th  cc. was  current in the sense discourage- ment. To those who have any regard for the interests of the  language  as dis- tinguished  from its pliability to their immediate purposes, it will seem of some  importance  that  it should not become necessary,  with  every word in which  -less  is appended to what can be either a noun or a verb, to decide which is this time intended. If the verb-compounds become much more frequent, we shall never know  that pitiless  and  harmless  may not mean 'that  cannot be pitied' and 'secure against  being harmed' as well as 'with- out the instinct of pity' and  'without harmfulness'.  We ought to be able to assume  that,  with  a few well-known exceptions,  -less  words mean simply without  what is  signified  by the noun they contain; and the way to keep  that assumption valid  is  to abstain from reckless  compounding of  -less  with verbs. A  hyphen should not be used unless one is necessary to sort out the three h  in one of those rare words in which -less  has been appended to a word ending  -//  (the OED  gives  bell-less, skill-less,  smell-less,  and   will-less). There is no need for one to separate two  Is,  as in  heelless,  soulless,  tailless, etc. And it is an abuse of the hyphen to make it serve as  an  indication  that  a familiar  compound is to be given a meaning  different from its usual one, as  in  These  present  cause-less  days.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 slander.,"The much quoted saying  'The  greater  the  truth  the greater'  (or  'worse')  'the  libel' makes us  all  occasionally curious  about  what a  1. is, and how it  differs from  a slander.  In  popular usage they  are synonymous,  meaning  a  deliberate, untrue,  derogatory  statement,  usually about  a  person,  whether  made  in writing  or  orally.  In  legal  usage  there",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
liberal,"are  important  differences. Each  is an untrue  and  defamatory  imputation made  by one  person  about  another which,  if  'published'  (i.e.  commu- nicated  to a  third  person),  can be a ground  for a  civil action  for  damages. Such  an  imputation  is a  libel  if  made in permanent form (writing, pictures, etc.)  or by  broadcasting.  It is a  slander if  made  in  fugitive form (e.g.  by  speak- ing  or  gestures).  A  further  distinction is  that  an  action  for  slander cannot ordinarily  succeed  without  proof  that actual damage  has  been caused;  in an action  for  libel this  is  unnecessary.  In both  cases proof  that  the  allegation was  true  is a  good defence. Deliberate defamation  of a  person  in permanent form  can  also  be  treated  as a  crime  (criminal  I.)  on the  ground  that it tends  to  provoke  a  breach  of the peace.

like,"in questionable constructions. 1.  It will be best to dispose first of what is, if it is a misuse at all, the most flagrant and  easily  recognizable misuse  of /. A sentence from Darwin quoted in the OED contains it in a short and unmistakable form:  Un- fortunately  few have  observed  L  you have done.  Most people use this con- struction daily in conversation. It is the established way of  putting  the thing among all who have not been taught to avoid it; the substitution of as  for /. in their sentences would seem to  them  artificial. But in good  writ- ing  this particular  /.  is rare, and even those writers  with  whom sound Eng- lish  is a  matter  of care and study rather than of right instinct, and to whom /. was once the natural word, usually  weed it out.  The OED's judgement is as follows: 'Used as con- junction, = ""like as"", as. Now gene- rally  condemned as vulgar or slovenly, though examples may be found in many recent writers of standing'. Besides  the Darwin quoted above, the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
like,"OED  gives  indisputable examples from Shakespeare,  Southey,  Newman, Morris,  and other 'writers of standing'. The reader who has no instinctive objection to the construction can now decide for himself  whether  he will consent to use it in talk, in  print,  in both,  or in neither. He knows  that  he will be able to defend himself if he is condemned for it, but  also  that,  until he has done so, he will be condemned. It remains to give a few newspaper examples so  that  there  may be no mistake about  what  the 'vulgar or slovenly'  use in its simplest form is: Or can these tickets be kept  (1.  the sugar cards  were)  by the  retailer?  /  The retail price  can never  reach  a  prohibitive  figure 1.  petrol has done. /  The waves of China's  revolution have risen  1. the waters of the rivers did last year. /  They studied  the rules of a game  1. a lawyer would study  an  imperfectly-drawn-up will.

In U.S. the colloquial use of /. as a conjunction has been carried a step further by treating it as equivalent not only  to  as  but  also  to  as if,  a practice that  still grates on English ears. Examples from the OED  Supp.  are The  old  fellow drank of the brandy  1. he was  used to it. /  None of  them  act  I.  they belonged to the hotel. 2.  The rest of this article is intended for  those who decide against the con- junctional use  that  has been already discussed,  and wish to avoid  also  some similar  questionable uses of a  less easily  recognizable kind.  All the examples in  i  were of the undisguised conjunctional use, and contained a subordinate clause  with  its verb  ;  most of  those now to come have no sub- ordinate verb, and in all of  them  /.  may be regarded as an adjective or adverb having  the additional power (cf.  worth) of  directly governing nouns as if it were a preposition.

The peculiarity of  these is  that  in each  there  is a previous noun or pronoun,  shores, county,  he,  with  which /. may agree as an  adjective, and an ellipsis of 'those' or  'what'  may be supposed. Such a defence  is neither  plausible  nor satisfactory,  and the sentences are no better  than others containing a verb. Of sentences in which  /.  is not fol- lowed by a verb, certain forms are unexceptionable, but are liable to ex- tensions  that  are not so. The un- questioned forms are  He talks  I.  an expert  and  You  are  treating me  I.  a  fool, in which /. is equivalent to a preposi- tional adverb = similarly to; and You,  I.  me, are disappointed,  in which /.  is equivalent either to an adverb as before, or perhaps rather to a pre- positional adjective = resembling in this respect.

1,".  It is always possible to use a peri- phrasis or a synonym, and to say  in a masterly  manner, at a timely moment, and the like, instead of  masterlily, timelily,  or to be  content  with  deco- rously  etc. instead of  manner  lily. 2.  A large  number  of adjectives in -ly  are established as adverbs  also.  So early,  (most  or  very)  LIKELY,  and the adjectives of periodical recurrence like daily  and  hourly.  A single quotation will show the danger of making one's own adverbs of this kind:  External evidence,  however, is  rare;  and its rarity gives  value to such  work  as Mr. here  masterly  does. 3.  Before adjectives and adverbs the -ly  adjective often stands instead of the  -lily  adverb, making a kind of in- formal compound. Though we should say  horribly  pale  and not  horrible  pale, we allow ourselves  ghastly  pale  rather than use  ghastlily;  so  heavenly bright, beastly cold, jolly  soon,  etc.—all  with- out the hyphen  that  would mark regu- lar  compounds. 4.  In sentences where it is just pos- sible,  though not natural, for a pre- dicative adjective to stand instead of an adverb,  that  way is sometimes taken with  an adjective in  -ly  though it would not be taken  with  another:  it happened  timely  enough,  though not opportune  enough;  she  nodded  friendly, though not  she nodded  amiable. 5.  Perhaps any adjective formed by appending  -ly  either to an adjective (kind,'kindly  ; dead, deadly)  or to a noun of  the kind  that  is easily used in apposi- tion like an  adjectival  epithet  (cowardly, cf.  the  coward  king;  soldierly,  cf.  a  soldier colonist  ;  scholarly,  cf.  the  scholar  gipsy)  is sometimes, though always consciously and noticeably, allowed to pass as an adverb :  it was ruffianly done, soldierly conducted,  scholarly expounded.

 words,"the  better  the critic, the fewer literary critics'  words he uses. The good critic is  aware  that  his public wants to understand, and he has no need to convince it  that  he knows  what  he is talking about by parading words  that it does not understand.  With  the inferior  critic the establishment of his status is the first consideration, and he effects it by so using, let us say, actuality, engaged,  and  inevitable,  that the reader shall become aware of a mysterious difference between  the sense  attaching to the words in ordin- ary  life and the sense now presented to him. He has taken  actuality  to mean actualness  or reality; the critic per- plexes him by  giving  it another sense, which it has a right to in French, where  actuel  means present, but not in English—the  sense of up-to-dateness, or resemblance not to  truth  in general but to present-day conditions ; and he does this  without  mentioning  that he is  gallicizing.

Those  who run to long  words  are  mainly  the  unskilful and  tasteless; they confuse pomposity with  dignity, flaccidity  with  ease,  and bulk  with  force;  see  LOVE  OF  THE LONG WORD.  A  special form  of  long word  is now to be  illustrated. When a  word  for the  notion wanted exists, some  people  (1)  forget  or do not  know that  word,  and  make  up  another from the same stem  with  an  extra suffix  or two;  or (2) are not  satisfied  with  a mere current word,  and  resolve  to decorate  it,  also  with  an  extra suffix; or  (3)  have heard  a  longer form  that resembles  it, and are not  aware  that this other form  is  appropriated  to another  sense.  Cases  of  (1)  and  (2)  are often indistinguishable;  the  motive differs,  but the  result  is the  same;  and they will here  be  mixed together, those of  (3) being  kept  apart. (1)  and  (2).  Needless lengthenings of established  words  due to  oversight  or caprice:  administrate (administer); assertative  (assertive)  ;  contumacity (contumacy);  cultivatable (cultivable); dampen (damp,  v.);  denunciate  (de- nounce)  ;  dubiety (doubt)  ;  epistolatory (epistolary);  experimentalize (experi- ment, v.)  ;  extemporaneously  (ex  tem- pore);  filtrate (filter,  v.);  preventative (preventive)  ;  quieten (quiet, v.)  ;  trans- portation (transport).",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 word.,"It  need hardly be said  that  shortness is a  merit in words. There are often reasons why shortness is not  possible;  much  less often  there  are occasions when length, not shortness, is desirable. But it is a general  truth  that  the short words are not only handier to use, but more powerful in effect; extra syllables reduce,  net  increase, vigour. This is particularly so in English, where the native words are short, and the long words are foreign. I  open  Paradise Lost  and  The Idylls of the King,  and at each first opening  there  face me: 'Know  ye not, then' said Satan,  fiWd with  scorn;  ''Know  ye not me? ye knew me  once  no mate For you, there sitting where  ye durst not  soar.'  j And in those days she made a little  song  And  call'd her  song  '  The  Song  of Love and Death', And  sang  it; sweetly  could  she  make and sing.

love of the long word,"teaching children to read  ;  they are the natural as well as the best ways of say- ing  what  was to be said. Nor is it in verse only  that  good English runs to monosyllables ; I open a new religious book, and find at once this passage about  the Kingdom of Heaven:  His effort  was, not to tell mankind about it, but to show it to them; and He said that those  who saw it would be convinced, not  by Him, but by it.  '  To this end was I  born,  and  for this  cause  came I into the world,  that!  should  bear  witness  unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth  my  voice.'  There for  once  he spoke  in  general  and abstract terms. Those  zoho  are of the truth, those who seek  truth for its own sake, will listen to Him and know that what he says is true. Twelve words  that  are not monosyl- lables  in  IOi  words; and  there  is no taint  whatever of affected simplicity in it. Good English does consist in the main of short words.  There  are many good  reasons, however, against any attempt  to avoid a polysyllable if it is  the word  that  will give our mean- ing  best;  moreover the occasional polysyllable  will have added effect from being set among short words. What  is here deprecated is the  tend- ency among the ignorant to choose, because it is a polysyllable, the word that  gives  their  meaning no  better  or even worse. Mr. Pecksniff, we are told, was in the frequent habit of using  any word  that  occurred to him as  having a good sound, and rounding a  sentence well,  without  much  care for its meaning. He still has his followers. In  the   article  LONG  VARIANTS,  ex- amples are given of long forms chosen in place of shorter ones of the same word or stem.  Attention  is here con- fined to certain words frequently used where unrelated shorter ones would be  better.  They are doubtless chosen primarily not  for  their  lengthj  but because they are in vogue; but  their vogue is in  turn  due to the  pompous effect conferred by length.  They  are: alternative,  mentality,  meticulous,  over- all,  percentage,  proportion,  proposition, protagonist,  all of which will be found in  their  dictionary places.

"luxuriant, luxurious.","Luxurious  is the adjective  that  belongs in sense to luxury  and conveys the ideas of com- fort or delight or  indulgence;  luxuriant has  nothing to do  with  these, implying only  rich growth, vigorous shooting forth, teeming, prolific; as  luxurious  to luxury,  so  luxuriant  to  exuberance. Luxurious  houses,  habits, life,  people, climate,  idleness, times, food, cushions, dreams,  abandonment,  desires;  luxuriant vegetation,  crops,  hair, imagination, invention,  style.  The points at  which they  touch  and become liable to con- fusion  are, first,  that  abundance, essential  to luxuriance or exuberance, also  subserves luxury, though not essential  to  it; and, secondly, their common property  in  the  verb  luxuriate, which means  both  to enjoy luxury and to show luxuriance. A luxurious  fancy is  one  that  dwells on luxury  ;  a luxuriant fancy  one  that  runs riot on any sub- ject, agreeable or  other.  The writer of  the following has used the wrong word in the first place and the right one in the second :  Mr. H. was a man of  somewhat striking outward appear- ance:  he  wore  a somewhat  luxurious beard;...  his  taste  for  a  beard  apparently resulted  in a somethat bushy  luxuriant growth  of hair all round his face. -ly.   1.  For the tendency among writers and speakers who are more conscientious than literary to suppose that  all adverbs must end in  -ly,  and therefore  to use  hardly, largely, strongly,  etc., where idiom requires hard,  large,  strong,  etc., see  UNIDIOMA- TIC  -LY. 2.  For participial adverbs like  deter- minedly,  see  -EDLY. 3.  It was said in the article  JINGLES that  the commonest form of ugly repetition was  that  of the  -ly  adverbs. It is indeed extraordinary, when one remembers the feats of avoidance performed by the elegant-variationist, the  don't-split-your-infinitivist,  and the anti-preposition-at-ender, to find how many people have no ears to hear this most obvious of all outrages on euphony. Not indeed on euphony pure  and simple, but on euphony and sense  in combination; for as many  -ly adverbs as one chooses may be piled on each other if one condition of sense  is  fulfilled—that  all these ad- verbs have the same relation to the same  word or to parallel words.  We are  utterly,  hopelessly,  irretrievably, ruined;  It is theoretically certain, but practically  doubtful', He may  probably or  possibly be in time.  These are all irreproachable. In the first, each of the three  adverbs expresses degree about ruined;  in  the  second, each limits the sense  of an adjective, the two adjectives being contrasted; in the third, the two give  degrees of likelihood about the same  thing,  that  is to say, in all  three cases  the  -ly  adverbs are strictly parallel.  Euphony has nothing to say against  repetition of  -ly  if  there  is point  in it, which  there  is if the adverbs are parallel. But, when parallelism is not  there  to comfort her, Euphony at once cries out in pain, though too often to deaf ears. Russian industry is at  present  prac- tically  completely  crippled.

The worst of letting the learned gentry  bully us out of our traditional Mahometan  and  Mahomet  (who ever heard  of  Mohammed  and the  mountain  ?) is  this : no sooner have we tried to be good  and learnt to say, or at least write,  Mohammed  than they are fired with  zeal to get  usa  step or two further on the  path  of  truth,  which at present seems  likely to end in  Muhammad with  a dot under the  h;  see  DIDACTIC- ISM.

Gram- matically  the  expression  is  admittedly above reproach, provided  that  it is without  the  indefinite article  (see  NO 2).  But  Milne took Fowler  to  task  for not having denounced  it as an  over- worked archaism,  'a  penny-in-the- slot  adjective which leaves nothing  in the writer's mind  as he  puts  it  down but  a  hopeful feeling  that  he is  being more amusing, more like Shakespeare and  the  Bible,  than  if  he had  szid  good'. Fowler disagreed.  Tor Mr.  Milne', he said,  'no mean  is the  perfect  cliché  : for  me it is not  indeed  a  favourite sub- stitute  for  considerable  or  meritorious or  first-class,  but a  blameless one.  . . . There  is  life  yet in  no mean,  and  I  trust that  as  long  as it  lives  it  will bear  in mind,  as  between  Mr.  Milne  and me, that  Codlin's  the  friend,  not  Short.' Today  the  verdict would probably go to Milne.  It is  fashionable  to  repro- bate  the use of  clichés  so  sweepingly as  to  induce  in  conscientious  but  timid writers  a  morbid dread  of  using  any expression  that  might  be so  described.

melodrama.,"The  term  was first ap- plied to plays in which music  (fj.eXos) accompanied the spoken word, but there  was no  singing.  Later m. ap- proximated to opera, but  with  the difference  that  the dialogue was en- tirely spoken and the songs inter- spersed, as in  The  Beggar's  Opera. Today the  term  is used of plays of a certain kind  without  regard to  their musical  content,  if any. It is generally used  with  some  contempt,  because the appeal of such plays is  especially  to the unsophisticated, whose acquaint- ance  with  human  nature  is superficial, but whose admiration for goodness and detestation of wickedness are ready and powerful.  The   melo- dramatist's task is to get his characters labelled good and wicked in his audience's minds, and to provide striking situations  that  shall provoke and relieve anxieties on behalf of poetic justice.  Whether  a play is or is not to be called a melodrama is there- fore often a  doubtful  question,  upon which different critics will hold differ- ent opinions. The typical characters of  a m. in its crudest  form  have been described as 'a diabolically clever villain  customarily engaged in the pursuit  of a  pure  and lovely heroine, constantly foiled and finally defeated by a manly and honest hero, who is frequently aided by a comic per- sonage'— Enc.

I  It is  useless  to  pretend  that there  will be  anything  but hostility be- tween  the  partners  in industry so  long  as this m.  persists.  It is not  easy  to say why  m.  should have ousted for this purpose other serviceable words such as  disposition,  attitude,  character,  mind. etc.;  perhaps  NOVELTY  HUNTING ac- counts for it. But we may surmise  that its  progress  to a  VOGUE  WORD  has  been helped by the disparaging flavour it has  taken on: it affords a convenient means of being rude politely.

Possibly  this pejorative use  derives  from  that  association of mental  with  patient, defective, hospital, and the like which has made it a  slang word for insane. It would be a striking example of the waywardness of words if  one  that  was formerly used for excess of  intellectuality ended by meaning an  insufficiency of it.

metaphor.,"Our task when we are returned  to  power  will be to  restore  to agricidture  the twin pillars of  efficiency and security.  'How infinite',  wrote Sir  Winston Churchill long before these words were spoken, 'is the  debt owed to metaphors by politicians who want to speak strongly but are not sure what they are going to say.' Hardly less,  as no one knows  better  than Sir Winston, is the  debt  owed  to metaphors by  those who, knowing what they are going  to say, wish to illumine and vivify  it. Moreover, our vocabulary is largely  built on metaphors; we use them,  though perhaps not consciously, whenever we speak or write.  The purpose of this article is to  give  some advice  about the handling of this in- dispensable  but ticklish instrument. See also  CLICHÉ, I.  Live and dead m. 2. Some pitfalls. 3.

metaphor,"ness  of their nature as substitutes for their literal equivalents, while others are  dead, i.e. have been so often used that  speaker and hearer have ceased to be aware  that  the words used are not literal.  But the line of distinction be- tween the live and the dead is a shift- ing  one, the dead being sometimes liable,  under the stimulus of an affinity or a repulsion, to galvanic stirrings indistinguishable  from  life.  Thus, in The men  were  sifting meal  we have a literal use  of sift;  in  Satan hath  desired to  have you, that he may sift you as wheat, sift  is a live m.; in  the sifting of evidence,  the m. is so familiar  that  it is about  equal chances whether  sifting  or examination  will be used, and  that  a sieve  is not present to the  thought— unless  indeed someone conjures it up by  saying  All the  evidence  must first be sifted  with acid tests,  or  with the microscope.  Under such a stimulus our  m. turns out to have been not dead but dormant. The other word, examine,  will do well enough as an example of the real stone-dead m.; the Latin  examino,  being from  examen the tongue of a balance, meant ori- ginally  to weigh; but, though weighing is  not done  with  acid tests or  micro- scopes  any more than sifting,  examine gives  no convulsive twitches, like  sift t at finding  itself  in their company. Examine,  then,  is dead m., and  sift only  half dead, or three-quarters. 2.  Some pitfalls: A. Unsustained m.; B. Overdone m.;  C.  Spoilt m.; D. Battles of the dead. E. Mixed m. 2.  A.

metaphor,"mere  fact  that he has announced his in- tention to ...  Metaphorical measuring, like literal, requires a more accommo- dating  instrument  than  a stubborn fact. 2.  B. Overdone m. The days are perhaps past  when  a figure was de- liberately chosen  that  could be worked out  with  line  upon  line of relentless detail, and the  following  well-known specimen is from Richardson :  Tost to and fro by the high winds of  passionate control,  I behold the desired  port,  the single  state, into which I would  fain steer;  but am kept off by the foaming billows  of a  brother's  and sister's envy, and by the  raging  winds of a  supposed invaded authority; while I see in Love- lace,  the rocks on one  hand,  and in Soltnes,  the sands on the other; and tremble,  lest I should split upon the former  or strike upon the latter. The present fashion is rather to develop a m. only by way of burlesque. All  that  need be asked of those who tend  to this form of satire is to remem- ber  that,  while some metaphors do seem to deserve such  treatment,  the number  of times  that  the same joke can safely be made, even  with  varia- tions, is limited. The limit has surely been exceeded, for instance,  with  'the long  arm of coincidence';  what  pro- portion  may this  triplet  of quotations bear to the  number  of times the thing has  been  done?— The  long  arm of coincidence  throws the Slifers into Mercedes's  Cornish garden a little too heavily,  j The author  does  not strain the muscles  of  coincidence's  arm to bring them into relation.  /  Then  the  long  arm of  coincidence  rolled  up its sleeves and set  to  work  with a rapidity and vigour which defy description. Modern overdoing, apart from bur- lesque, is chiefly accidental, and results not from too  much  care, but from too little:  The most  irreconcilable  of Irish landlords are beginning to  recognize that we are on the eve of the dawn of a new day in Ireland.

metaphor,"2.  C. Spoilt m. The essential  merit of  real or live m. being to add vivid- ness  to  what  is to be conveyed, it need hardly be said  that  accuracy of detail is  even more needed in metaphorical than  in literal expressions. The habit of  m., however, and the habit of accuracy do not always go together: Yet Jaurès was the  Samson  who  upheld the pillars  of the  Bloc.  /  Yet what  more distinguished  names does the Anglican Church of the last  reign  boast  than  those of  F. D. Maurice, Kingsley, Stanley, Robertson  of  Brighton,  and even, if we will  draw  our  net  a little  wider,  the great  Arnold? j He was the very  essence of  cunning, and the  incarnation  of a book-thief.  Samson's way  with  pillars was not to uphold  them  ; we draw nets closer,  but cast  them  wider; and  what is  the incarnation of a thief? Too, too solid  flesh indeed. Similarly a m. may be spoilt if so used  that  the  picture  it is  intended to evoke becomes incon- gruous or ridiculous.  We must not allow  ourselves to be stampeded into stagnation.  /  This  is a virgin field  preg- nant with possibilities.  /  She drew the teeth  of Miss  Reynolds's  forehand with cross-court  volleys.

In The Covenanters  took  up arms  there is  no m.; in  The  Covenanters  flew to arms  there  is one  only— flew  to  for quickly took up; in  She flew to arms in defence  of her darling  there  are two, the arms being now metaphorical as well as  the flying. Moreover, the two meta- phors are separate ones; but, being dead ones, and also not inconsistent with  each  other,  they lie together quietly enough. But dead metaphors will not lie quietly together if  there  was repugnance  between  them  in life; e'en in  their  ashes live  their  wonted  fires, and they get up and fight:  It is im- possible  to  crush  the Government's  aim to  restore  the means of living and work- ing  freely. Crush  for baffle,  aim  for purpose, are  both  dead metaphors so long  as they are  kept  apart; but the juxtaposition forces on us the  thought that  you cannot crush an aim. /",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

E. Mixed metaphors.  For the examples given in D, tasteless word- selection is a  fitter  description  than mixed  m.,  since each of the words that  conflict  with  others is not intended as  a  m.  at all.  Mixed  m.  is more ap- propriate  when  one or  both  of the terms can only be consciously meta- phorical. Little warning is needed against  it; it is so conspicuous as seldom to get  into  speech or  print undetected.  This  is not the time to throw  up the sponge,  when the enemy, already weakened and  divided,  are  on the run to a  new  defensive position. A  mixture  of prize-ring and  battle- field.  /  The Rt. Hon. Gentleman is lead- ing  the  people  over the  precipice  with his head in the sand.  A strange con- fusion  between  the behaviour of Gadarene swine and  that  of ostriches. / There  is every indication that Nigeria will be a tower of  strength  and will  forge ahead.  A  mixture  of a fortress and a ship.  /  The Avon and  Dorset  River Board  should not act like King  Canute, bury its head in the sands, and ride rough-shod  over the interests of those who  live by the land and enjoy their fishing.  (A  picture  that  staggers the imagination, and a libel on a great king.) In the following  extract  from a speech it is difficult to be sure how many times metaphors are mixed; readers versed in the mysteries of oscillation  may be able to decide:  No society,  no community, can place its house  in such a condition that it is always  on a rock, oscillating  between solvency  and insolvency.  What  I have to  do is to see that our house is  built upon  a solid foundation,  never allow- ing  the possibility of the Society's  life- blood being sapped.  Just in  proportion as you are careful in looking after the condition  of your income,  just  in pro- portion  as you deal with them carefully, will the solidarity of the Society's financial  condition  remain intact. Im- mediately you begin to  play fast and loose  with your income  the first blow at your financial stability  will have been struck. 3.  Self-consciousness and mixed m. The gentlemen of the Press regularly devote a small percentage of  their time  to accusing each  other  of mixing metaphors or announcing  that  they are themselves  about  to do so  (What  a mixture of  metaphors!  If we may mix our metaphors,  or  change the m.),  the offence apparently being not to mix them,  but to be unaware  that  you have done it.  The odd thing is  that, whether  he is on the offensive or the defensive,  the  writer  who ventures to talk of mixing metaphors often shows that  he does not know  what  mixed m. is.  Two typical examples of the offen- sive  follow:  The Scotsman says:  'The crowded  benches of the Ministerialists contain the  germs  of  disintegration.  A more  ill-assorted majority could hardly be  conceived, and presently the Opposi- tion must realize of what small account is the  manoeuvring  of the  Free-Fooders or  of any other section of the party. If the sling be only  properly  handled, the new Parliamentary Goliath will  be  over- thrown  easily enough. The  stone  for the sling  must, however, be found on the Ministerial  side of the House, and not on  the Opposition  side'.  Apparently the stone  for the sling will be a  germ.  But doubtless  mixed feelings lead to mixed metaphors.  /  'When  the Chairman of Committees — a  politician of their own hue — allowed  Mr. Maddison to move his amendment in favour of secular education,  a decision which  ivas  not quite in  accordance  with precedent, the floodgates  of sectarian  controversy  were",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

metaphor,"opened,  and the apple of  discord — the endowment  of the  gospel  of Cowper- Temple — was  thrown into the  midst  of the  House of  Commons.'*  What  a mix- ture  of metaphor! One pictures this gospel-apple  battling with the stream released  by the  opened  floodgates. In the first  passage,  we are well rid of  the germs before we hear of the sling,  and the  mixture  of  metaphors is  quite imaginary.  Since literal benches often contain literal germs,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
but,"crowded  benches  and  germs  of dis- integration  are here separate meta- phors for a numerous party and tendencies to disunion, our critic had ready  to his hand in the first sentence, if  he had but known it, something much more like a  mixture  of meta- phors than  what  he mistakes for one. In the second  passage,  the floodgates and the apple are successive meta- phors,  unmixed;  the mixing of  them is  done by the critic himself, not by the criticized; and as to  gospel-apple, by which it is hinted  that  the  mixture is  triple, the original writer had merely mentioned  in  the  gospel  phrase  the  thing compared side by side  with  what  it is compared to, as when one explains  the Venice  of  the  North  by  adding  Stockholm. Writers who are on the defensive apologize  for  change  and  mixture  of metaphors as though one was as bad as  the  other.  The two things are in fact entirely different. A man may change  his metaphors as often as he likes;  it is for  him  to judge  whether the result will or will not be unplea- santly  florid. But he should not ask our leave  to  do  it; if the result is bad, his apology  will not mend matters, and if  it is not bad no apology was called for.  On  the other hand, to mix meta- phors, if the  mixture  is real, is an offence  that  should not have been apologized  for, but avoided. In either case  the motive is the  same—mortal fear  of being accused of mixed m. :— .  . .  showed  that  Free  Trade could provide  the jam without  recourse  being had  to  Protective  food-taxes; next came a  period  in which (to mix our  meta- phors)  the jam was  a  nice  slice  of  tariff pie for  everybody;  but then came the Edinburgh  Compromise,  by which  thé jam for the towns was that  there  were  to be  . . .  When  jam  is used in  three  suc- cessive  sentences in its hackneyed sense  of consolation, it need hardly be considered in the middle one of  them a  live m. at all. However, the as-good- as-dead  m. of jam  is  capable of being stimulated into life if anyone is so fool- ish  as to bring into contact  with  it another half-dead m. of its own (i.e. the foodstuff) kind; and it  was  after all mixing metaphors to say the jam was a  slice of pie. But  then  the way of escape was to withdraw either the jam or the pie, instead of forcing  them  to- gether down our throats  with  a ramrod of  apology. /  Time sifts the  richest granary,  and  posterity  is a dainty feeder. But LyalVs words, at any  rate — to  mix the  metaphor — will  escape  the blue pen- cil  even of such drastic editors as they. Since  all  three  metaphors are live ones, and  they  are the sifter and the feeder, the working of these into grammatical connexion  with  the blue pencil does undoubtedly mix metaphors. But  then our author  gives  us to understand  that he knows he is doing it, and surely  that is  enough. Even so some liars reckon that  a lie is no disgrace provided  that they wink at a bystander as they tell it; even so those who are addicted to the phrase 'to use a vulgarism'  expect  to achieve  the feat of being at once vulgar andsuperiortovulgarity.(SeesuPERiOR- ITY.)  Certainly we cannot detect the sug- gested  lack of warmth in the  speech  as it is  printed,  for in  his  speech,  as  in the  Prime Minister's,  it  seems  to us that (if  we  may change  the metaphor) exactly the  right note  was struck. / It is  essential,  then, that the  Labour  Party  should  go into its election  campaign with the engine run- ning.

Certainly, gentlemen, you may change  or mix your metaphors, if it seems  good to you; but you may  also be  pretty  sure  that,  if you feel the necessity  of proclaiming the fact, you had  better  have abstained from it. / Two  of the  trump  cards  played  against",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

metaphysics,"and  metaphysical  are so often  used as quasi-learned and vaguely  depreciatory substitutes for various  other terms, for theory and theoretical, subtle(ty), (the) super- natural, occult(ism), obscure  and obscurity, philosophy and philosophic, academic(s),  and so forth,  that  it is pardonable to forget  that  they have a real  meaning of their own, especially as  the usual resource of those who suddenly  realize  that  their notion of a word's meaning is  hazy—an  appeal to its  etymology—will  not serve. It is agreed  that  Metaphysics  owes its name to the accident  that  the  part  of Aristotle's works  that  treated  of metaphysical questions stood after (fiera)  the  part  concerned  with  physics (T(1  <f>voi.Ka),  and  that   the  word's etymology  is therefore devoid of sig- nificance.  It is indeed actually mis- leading  if it  suggests  the inference, as it has to some,  that  m. is 'the science of  things transcending what is physical or natural'. Even Saintsbury, for instance,  though  admitting  some justice in the criticism of the label 'metaphysical'  invented by Dryden and adopted by Johnson for  Donne, Cowley, and their school, maintained that  it was 'not inappropriately used for  the habit, common to this school of  poets, of always seeking to express something after, something behind, the obvious first sense and suggestion of  a subject'. Metaphysics is the branch of philo- sophy  that  deals  with  the ultimate nature of things, or considers the questions,  What  is the world of things  we know?  (ontology)  and, How do we know it?  (epistemology),  though some philosophers would confine the term  to the first. Such being the subject of Metaphysics, it is not wonderful, in view of the infinity of theories and subtlety of arguments evoked,  that  it should have come by some or all of the wrong acceptations mentioned above.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

'Ante- and post-classical' say Lewis and Short;  that  is, you may read your Cicero and Virgil and Horace and Livy  through and never  meet  it, and when it is unearthed in Plautus or somewhere it means not  what  the journalists made it mean, but just frightened.

But the word died out, and when it was resusci- tated  in the  19th  c, it was given a new sense for which it was not in the least  needed, and freely used as an unwanted synonym for careful, exact, punctilious, scrupulous, precise, etc. It would be idle to try to put it back into an  etymological strait-jacket and to apply it only to the care  that  has its origin  in terror of being caught break- ing  rules or misstating facts, but if it is  to escape the reproach of being a SUPERFLUOUS  WORD  it  should  at  least be confined to a degree of care, not necessarily  excessive or  fussy—we have  pernickety  for  that—but  greater than  what  is implied by  punctilious  or scrupulous.

diminish.,"Minify  is a badly formed and little used word. It owes its existence to the desire for a neat opposite to the correctly formed  magnify,  but is now chiefly  used by people who, rightly enough offended by the extension of minimize  to improper meanings, are too ready to catch at the first alterna- tive. A slight  further  search would bring  them  through  minish  (to which the  only—but  fatal—objection  is  that it is archaic) to  diminish.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
minimal,"366 Minimize  is  both  a rightly formed and a  current  word, but unfortunately current  in more senses than it has any right to. It should have been  kept strictly to the limits imposed by its derivation from  minimus  (not  less  or little, but least), and therefore should always  have meant either to reduce to the least possible  amount  (We must minimize the friction)  or to put at the lowest possible estimate  (it  is your interest  to minimize his guilt).  The meaning 'lessen' given to  minimize  in the following quotations flagrantly ig- nores the essential superlative element by qualifying it adverbially :  The utility of our  convoy  would have  been  consider- ably  minimized  had it not included one of  these.  /  An open window or door would  greatly minimize  risk. Minify  should be given up as a  SUPER- FLUOUS  WORD  ;  minimize  should be  kept as  near as may be to its  proper  senses; magnify  should have as its opposite, in one of its senses  diminish  (the dimin- ishing  end of the  telescope),  and in another  underestimate  (neither magnify nor  underestimate  the difficulties).

Again, in a  Board of  51  a m. of one  may be either 25 persons (A) or one person (B).  The  point  need not be laboured, but should be appreciated. There is a  tacit convention, in the interests of lucidity,  that  adjectives naturally ap- propriate to magnitude shall not  be used  with  m.  to emphasize smallness of  number,  and another  that  a  m.  of one  shall always mean one person. But the first is not always  kept  to: With  a considerable m.  of the votes polled,  the Tory Party have  obtained  a clear  and substantial  majority  over all other  parties in the House.  Oddly enough, the newspaper whose own words those are has this paragraph about  a fellow offender:  Says a motor- ing  writer in a Sunday paper;  'It  is time that the interests of the public at large  were  considered  by attacking the real  evil — the  dangerous and incon- siderate  driver. Fortunately, he  consti- tutes the  vast minority  of motor-car owners  and drivers'. We know what is meant, but  'the  vast  minority'  is a very unfortunate  way of saying it.

misquotation,"often wrongly than rightly quoted may  be  useful.  The  misquoting  of phrases  that  have survived  on  their own merits  out of  little-read authors (e.g.  of  Fine  by  degrees  etc. from Prior, usually  changed  to  Small  etc.)  is a  very venial  offence;  and  indeed  it is  almost a  pedantry  to  use  the  true  form instead of  so established  a  wrong one ;  it  would be absurd  to  demand  that  no one should ever use  a  trite  quotation  with- out  testing  its  verbal accuracy. Again, the established change made  in the Leave-noi-a-rack-behind  quotation  by shifting  the  baseless  fabric  of  this vision from some lines earlier into  the  place of  another phrase  that  does  not  suit general  use so  well,  and the  common telescoping  of  Pride  goeth  before  de- struction  and an  haughty spirit  before a  fall,  though most people  no  doubt make  them  without  knowing what they  are  doing, might reasonably enough  be  made knowingly,  and are  no  offence.  But  when  a  quota- tion comes from such  a  source  as a  well-known play  of  Shakespeare,  or Lycidas,  or the  Bible  or  Prayer Book, to  give  it  wrongly  at  least requires excuse,  and  any  great prevalence  of such misquotation would prove  us discreditably  ignorant  of our own literature. Nevertheless, such words as  A  poor  thing, but  my  own,  are  often so  much more used than  the  true  form that  their accuracy  is  sure  to be  taken for  granted unless occasional  attempts like  the  present  are  made  to  draw attention  to  them.

It  will be  a  year  before  it is done;  the effect of  that  is negative, since  it means  that  the thing will  not be finished in  less  than twelve months; but  its expression is affirmative, there  being no negative word in it.  It is not  possible  to do it under a year;  the effect and the expression of that  are obviously  both  negative.  It is impossible to do it under a year; the effect  of  that  is negative, but the expression is technically affirmative. Though  there  is no difference in meaning between the last two, the difference of expression decides be- tween  more  and  less:  It is not pos- sible  to do it under a year,  m.  less  in six months; It is impossible to do it under a year,  m. more  in six months. What  governs the decision is the words required to  fill  up the ellipsis: It is not  possible  to do it under a year, much   ?  (is it  possible  to do it) in six months;  It is  impossible  to  do it under a  year,  much   ?  (is it  impossible)  to do it in six months. Careless  writers make the mistake of letting the general effect run away with  them  instead of considering the expression. In the example  that  has just been worked out the fault is a slight  one, because the wrong filling up of the ellipsis  (is it  possible  instead of  is it  impossible)  is so  easy  as to seem no  less  natural to the reader than to the writer.

 e.,"Needless uncertainty pre- vails  about  the spelling of inflexions and derivatives formed from words ending in  mute  e. Is this -e to be re- tained, or omitted? It is a question that  arises in thousands of words, and especially  in many  that  are not sepa- rately recorded in the dictionaries, so that  the timid speller cannot get it answered in a hurry. It is also one to which different answers are possible; every  dictionary-maker  probably thinks  that  if he were recording all words  with  an  internal-mute-e  prob- lem he would answer the question  with paternal but arbitrary wisdom for each word; but he also knows  that  it would be absurd for him to  attempt  to give  even all those  that  are likely to be wanted. The need is not for such a  gigantic undertaking, but for a rule of  the simplest kind and  with  the fewest exceptions, to deliver us from the present chaos: the  dictionary- makers are not agreed  about  the spell- ing  even of such common words as blam{e)able,  lik(e)able,  saleable,   size- able,  and  tam{e)able,  and in the rulings even of a single authority may be found such seemingly arbitrary dis- tinctions as  lateish  but  whitish,  ageing but  icing. To get an idea of the  number  of words concerned, the reader should consider the following questions, and realize  that  some of the items stand for thousands, some for hundreds, and some for dozens, of similar  cases. Does  pale  make  paleish  or  palish  ;  love, loveing  or  loving, loveable  or  lovable', strive,  striveing  or  striving;  excite, exciteable  or  excitable;  move,  moveable or  movable;  like,  likely  or  likly;  dote, doteard  or  dotard;  judge,  judgement or  judgment;  hinge,  hingeing  or  hinging; singe,  singeing  or  singing;  gauge, gaugeable  or  gaugable;  notice,  notice- able  or  noticable;  mouse,  mousey  or mousy;  change,  changeing  or  changing, changeling  or  changling;  hie,  hieing  or hiing;  glue,  gluey  or  gluy;  due,  duely  or duly;  blue,  blueish  or  bluish;  whole, wholely  or  wholly} The only satisfactory rule, excep- tions to which need be very few, would be this: If the suffix begins  with  a consonant, the  mute  e should be re- tained  ;  if the  suffix  begins  with  a vowel, the  mute  e should be  dropped.  Apply- ing  this to the list above, we get  (with the wrong results in italics as a basis for exceptions); palish; loving; lov- able;  striving; excitable; movable; likely;  dotard; judgement; hinging; singing;  gaugàble;  noticable;  mousy; changing;  changeling;  hiing; gluy; duely;  bluish;  wholely. The  chief  exception   {gaugeable, noticeable,  singeing)  is  that  e remains even before a vowel when  the  soft sound of c or g is to be indicated in the spelling  (as before  -able,  where it would normally be hard), or where the e  must  be retained to distinguish the word from another (e.g.  singeing  from singing,  dyeing  from  dying, holey  from holy  and  routeing  from  routing).

For practical purposes,  then,  a single rule,  with  a single exception, would suffice—stated  again below. The only sacrifice  involved would be  that  of the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 e,"power (most arbitrarily and incon- sistently exercised at present) of in- dicating the sound of an earlier vowel by insertion or omission of the e {mileage  for fear  that  milage  may be pronounced  mil-).  The history of dispiteous  is perhaps the best com- ment;  from  despite  came  despitous (dïspï'tus);  when the spelling changed to  despiteous  the pronunciation changed to  dispî'tïus,  and out of this came a false  association  with  piteous,  cutting the word off from its etymology and attaching it to  pity  instead of to spite. RULE When  a suffix is added to a word ending in  mute  e, the  mute  e should be  dropped  before a vowel, but not before a consonant. EXCEPTION The e should be  kept  even before a vowel if it is needed to indicate the soft sound of a preceding g or c or to distinguish  a word from another  with the same spelling. EXAMPLES change,  changeling,  changing, change- able;  singe,  singeing',  hinge,  hinging', trace,  traceable;  move,  movable;  horse, horsy;  strive,  striving;  pale,  palish; judge,  judgement. It is not  suggested  that  this rule could now be applied universally; there  are some words in which an unnecessary  e is too firmly entrenched to be dislodged. For instance the Scottish word  timeous  is ordinarily so  spelt;  mileage  has established a strong position against  milage  ;  rateable has  been adopted as the official spelling  (though  The Times  with  com- mendable  boldness prefers  ratable), and  ageing  is usually so  written, with  the authority of the OED, though it is not clear why we should so  spell it when we are  content  to write  raging.  But the rule would at least  settle the question for the very large  number  of words whose spelling is  still in the balance, and would give much  needed guidance to those who 377",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

mutual,"wish to use adjectives in  -able  not given separately in the dictionaries. For similar problems  with  adjectives ending  -y  and verbs ending  -ye  see -EY  AND -Y IN ADJECTIVES and  VERBS  IN -IE,  -Y, AND -YE  J. mutual  is a well-known trap. The essence  of its meaning is  that  it in- volves  the relation  x  is or does to  y as  y  to  x,  and not the relation  x  is or does to  z  as  y  to  z.  From this it follows  that  our mutual  friend  Jones (meaning Jones who is your friend as well as mine), and all similar phrases, are misuses of  m.  An example of the mistake, which is very common, is: On the other hand, if we  [i.e. the Western  Powers]  merely sat with our arms folded there would be a peaceful penetration  of Russia by the country [i.e.  Germany]  which was the mutual enemy  [i.e. of  both  Russia and the Western  Powers]. In such places common  is  the  right word, and the use of  m.  betrays ignorance of its meaning. It should be added, however,  that  m. was formerly used  much  more loosely than it now is, and  that  the OED, giv- ing  examples of such looseness, goes no further  in condemnation than  'Com- monly censured as incorrect, but still often  used  in the collocations  m.  friend, m. acquaintance,  on account of the ambiguity of  common'.  The Dickens title  has no  doubt  much  to do  with  the currency of  m. friend.   Perhaps it should now be regarded as qualifying for  admission  to  the  STURDY  INDE- FENSIBLES. Another fault is of a different kind, betraying not ignorance, but lack of the taste or care  that  should prevent one from saying twice over  what  it suffices  to say once. This happens when  m.  is combined  with  some  part of  each other,  as in :  It is this fraternity of  Parliament-men  serving  a common cause,  mutually comprehending each other's problems  and difficulties, and respecting  each  other's  rights and liber- ties,  which is the foundation of the structure.

By those  who  wished  to  mark their adher- ence  to  this  original  sense  the  word was sometimes pronounced  mxth.

It  does  not  mean  an  infi- nite number,  nor the  greatest possible number,  nor  necessarily  even  a  large number,  but  simply  the  particular number  that  we  may  find ourselves concerned  with  when  we  come  to details;  it is  short  for  'one  or  two  or three  or  whatever  the  number  may be'.  It  follows  that  the  common  use of  to the  nth  for to the  utmost possible extent  (  The Neapolitan  is an  Italian  to the  nth  degree.  /  Minerva was  starched to  the nth)  is  wrong.  It is  true  that sentences  can be  constructed  in  which the popular  and the  mathematical senses  are  reconciled  {Though  the  force were  increased  to the nth,  it  would not avail),  and  here,  no  doubt,  from  the idea  of  something  indefinitely  large, the origin  of the  misuse  is to be  found.

The  slowness  with   which  the naturalization of the words has pro- ceeded is curious and regrettable. For it will hardly be denied  that  they deserve a warm welcome as supplying a  shade of meaning not provided by the nearest  single  English words. The OED definition, for instance, 'Natural, unaffected, simple, artless', clearly omits  elements—the  actor's uncon- sciousness  and the observer's amuse- ment—that  are essential to the ordinary man's idea of naïveté. Unconsciously and amusingly simple;  naive  means not  less  than  that,  and is therefore a  valuable word. But, as long as the majority of Englishmen are  kept  shy of  it by  what  is to  them  queer spelling and pronunciation, its value will not be exploited. The difficulty is greater with  the noun than  with  the  adjective; many by this  time  write  naive  without the diaeresis, and many call it  nâv,  a pronunciation  recognized  by most dictionaries,  though  nâ'êv  is given first place.  But  naivety,  though it was used by  Hume  and other  i8th-c.  writers, has not yet made much headway against naïveté',  till it wins, these potentially useful words  will  be very much wasted.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 appellations.,"'How  now, daughter and cousin', was the greeting given  to  Celia  and Rosalind by Duke Frederick,  who afterwards,  with  more precision, admonished the latter 'You, niece,  provide yourself' ;  'Thou  bringst me peace and happiness, son John' said  Henry IV; 'Prepare her, wife, against  this wedding-day' said Capu- let.  Except for  father, mother,  grand- father,  and  grandmother,  this custom of  using a relationship-term by way of direct address disappeared gradually during the  19th  c;  husband  and  zvife seem to have been the first to go and uncle,  aunt,  and  sister  (often abbre- viated to  sis)  to have lasted longest. So  far as disparity of age makes it seemly  for us still to use these terms in speaking  to our relations we now ordinarily  add the Christian  name—- Uncle  John,  Auntiie)  Mary, Cousin Tom —though  not, as was often done until comparatively recently, the sur- name— Uncle  Smith  and  Aunt  Jones. Though  father  and  mother  are still in use,  the more affectionate alternatives papa  and  mamma,  long current, have been superseded by  daddy  and  mum- my,  and are now only used as deliberate revivals.  The Victorian schoolboy's words for his parents,  pater  (or  gover- nor,  abbreviated to  gov.)  and  mater  are obsolete. Modern trend has been away from formality and towards familiarity. Though service  with  the Forces has increased  the use of  sir  by young people to their elders (at the same  time as  it has been falling into disuse as a  mark of difference in social status), the duty of  saying  sir  to one's father, once generally recognized, has long ago  been dropped. It is indeed far from unknown for young people to call  by their Christian names not only uncles and aunts but  also  fathers and mothers, and even sometimes  grand- fathers and grandmothers. Greater freedom in the use of Christian names is  in fact one of the most striking of the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

names and appellations,"recent changes in this field. In Vic- torian days as soon as a  girl  put her hair  up and wore long skirts and a boy went  into tails they became  Miss  Jones and  Mr. Smith;  and quite a long apprenticeship, perhaps even formal permission, was needed before they were  Mary  and  John  to each  other. Today young people would think it ridiculous not to be on christian-name terms from the start; it may take almost as long for  them  to become familiar  with  one another's surnames as  it used to take to qualify for drop- ping  them.  A natural consequence of this is the discontinuance of the old practice of calling the eldest of the Jones  sisters  Miss  Jones  and the others Miss Mary, Miss Jane,  and so on. In Jane Austen's day it seems to have been not uncommon for hus- bands and wives to address each other in the same  way  as a stranger would; Mrs.  Bennet said  Mr. Bennet  to her husband  and Lady Bertram   Sir Thomas  to hers. By the  time  that Dickens was writing this must have become  less  usual, for we are told as a  circumstance  worth  recording  that Mr.  Dombey  had been  Mr. Dombey to his first wife when she first saw him, and he was  Mr. Dombey  when she died. Today it would be something of a  solecism, among social equals, for Mr. Dombey to call his wife  Mrs. Dombey  (or vice  versa),  even when referring to her in conversation  with someone else; good manners  permit nothing more formal than  my wife  or my husband  and would favour  Fanny or  Paul,  unless the person addressed is  so slight an acquaintance  that  he might not know who is meant. For him, however, unless he is on christian- name terms  with  the spouse referred to, the alternatives would be  your wife (husband)  or  Mrs. (Mr.) Dombey;  what is  friendliness on one side would be presumption on the other and  what would be stiffness on one side is courtesy on the  other. In modes of direct address between friends  and acquaintances the  B.B.C. has  introduced an innovation. In talk- ing  about  people we habitually refer to them  by Christian name and surname, as  for instance  William  Jones  and  Mary Smith,  but we do not call  them  that  in speaking  to  them;  they will be  Mr. Jones, Jones,  or  William, Mrs.  (or  Miss) Smith  or  Mary,  according to the degree  of our acquaintanceship. In broadcast  conversation,  however, people not only habitually call one another  William  Jones  and  Mary Smith  but repeat the names much more often than would be natural in ordinary talk. The reason for this convention is presumably  that  it  both conduces to an atmosphere of intimacy and  also  helps an audience who have only  their ears to guide  them  in identi- fying  the speakers. Perhaps some day it will spread into normal  usage,  but not  without  resistance, especially to the beginning of letters in this way (Dear  A.B.).  This excites curiously strong  feelings.  'An unspeakable  usage' says  one of the contributors to the symposium  Noblesse  Oblige  (see U AND NON-U).  'An odious practice'  says  a member of Parliament, voicing his indignation  in  The Times,  perpetrated mostly by 'party officials who have been instructed to place me on the mat . . . television tycoons and others who could be called ignorant'. Pro- fessor  Ross,  however, who started all the U-and-non-U business, attributes the practice mainly to 'intellectuals of any  class'.  If the intellectuals and the ignorant are indeed in league over this, the chances of successful resistance do not look bright. Of the problem how to address a parent-in-law no generally satisfactory solution seems yet to have been found. Father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are barely   tolerable  even facetiously. Present practice apparently varies from calling  them  Mr.  and  Mrs. Smith,  as though they were strangers, to using their Christian names as though they were  contemporaries— as  indeed they sometimes are. More on this subject may be found in R.  W.  Chapman's  essay  Names, Designations  and Appellations  (SPE Tract  XLVII)  to which acknow- ledgement is made.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The use of  near  in the sense of  nearly (Not near so often; near dead with fright; near  a  century ago)  has been  so far  affected  by the  vague impression  that  adverbs  must  end in ly  as to be  obsolescent;  see  UNIDIO- MATIC  -LY  for  other  words  in  which the process has not gone so far.

1.,"He  seems  to think that the Peronne  bridge-head  was abandoned earlier  than  need  have  been,  j It was assumed  that Marshal  Foch's  reserves and army of manœuvre had been used up and  need  no  longer  to be taken into account  as a uniform,  effective  body. These extracts suffice to show  that lapses  in grammar or idiom may occur with  need.  The first looks like some confusion  between the verb and the noun  need',  at any rate the two right ways  of putting it would be (a)  earlier than it  (i.e. the bridge-head)  need  have been  (sc.  abandoned), where  need  is the verb,  and  (b)  earlier  than  there  was need  (sc. to abandon it), where  need is  the noun. With  uncertainties  whether  need  is a  noun or a verb, whether  needs  is a  verb or a plural noun or an adverb, and  what relation is borne to the verbal  needs  and  needed  by the ab- normal  need  often substituted for them, there are certain difficulties. The writer of the second extract above has missed  the point of idiom  that,  while needs  and  needed  are ordinary verbs followed by infinitive  with  to,  the abnormal  need  is treated as a mere auxiliary,  like  must,  requiring no  to; the reserves  needed no  longer  to be taken,  or  did not  need  any  longer  to  be taken,  but  need  no  longer  be taken, into account.  The rules for the use of  need instead  of  needs  and  needed  are: It is used only in interrogative  and  negative sentences ; in such sentences it is more idiomatic than the normal forms, which are,  however,  permissible; if  need  is preferred, it is followed by infinitive without  to,  but  needs  and  needed  require to  before their infinitive.

 variants,"on by irresponsible expressions of opinion. In this book, therefore, refer- ence is made to the present article or to  that  called  SUPERFLUOUS  WORDS regarding  many words  that  either are or ought to be dead, but have not yet been  buried. This article is concerned only  with those  that  can be considered by-forms differing  merely in suffix or in some such minor point from other words of the same stem and meaning. Some- times the mere reference has been thought sufficient;  more  often short remarks are added qualifying or ex- plaining  the particular condemnation; some of these references are listed below to enable the reader to examine details.  Here the general principle may  profitably be laid down  that having  two names for the same thing is a  source not of strength but of weak- ness,  because the reasonable assump- tion is  that  two words mean two things, and confusion results when they do not. On the other hand, it may be much too hastily assumed  that  two words do mean the same thing; they may,  for instance, denote the same object  without  meaning the same thing if  they  imply  that  the  aspect from which it is regarded is different, or are appropriate in different mouths, or differ  in rhythmic value or in some other respect  that  may escape a cursory examination. To take an example or two : it is hard to see why  hydrocéphalie and  hydrocephalous  should coexist and puzzle us to no purpose by coexisting; but  correctitude  by the side of  correct- ness  has a real value, since it was expressly  made to suggest by its sound   conscious  rectitude  and so present correctness in an invidious light.  Again, it would be rash to decide  that  dissimulate  was a need- less  variant for  dissemble  on the grounds  that  it means the same and is  less  used and  less  clearly  English, without  thinking long enough over it to remember  that  simulate  and  dis- simulation  have a right to be heard on the question.

 1.,"Generally speaking,  English  grammar today regards  two negatives as cancelling each  other and producing an  affirma- tive  j  the proper meaning of  Nobody didn't go  is  that  everyone  went. But  it is by no means true, as is some- times supposed,  that  this is axiomatic. In  some other  languages  (Greek for example) negative symbols are multi- plied  to  reinforce  one  another; a  speaker  'spreads  as it were a thin layer  of negative colouring over the whole of the sentence instead of con- fining it to one  single  place' (Jesper- sen).  We used to do the same  (Nor what he said, though it lacked form a  little, was not like madness),  and multiplication for emphasis survives in  vulgar speech  with  little risk cf ambiguity.   Everyone knew what Mr. Dombey's butler meant when he said  that  he hoped  that  he might 'never hear of no foreigner never boning nothing out of no travelling chariot', and everyone knows what is meant when, in a television interview, the  question 'Are you still a trades- union  official'  is answered 'I'm not nothing no more'. In educated speech the idiom survives in such sentences as  /  shouldn't wonder if it didn't rain. See  NOT  4. 2.  Of actual blunders, as distinguished from lapses of taste and style, perhaps the commonest, and those  that  afflict their author when he is detected  with the least sense of proper shame, are various  mishandlings of negatives. Writers who appear educated enough to know whether a sentence is right or wrong will put down the opposite of  what they mean, or something different from what they mean, or what means nothing at all, apparently quite satisfied so long as the reader can be trusted to make a shrewd  guess  at what they ought to have  said  instead of  taking  them  at their word; to his possible  grammatical sensibilities they pay  no heed whatever, having none themselves.  It is parallel clauses  that especially  provide opportunities for going  wrong, the problem being to secure  that  if  both  are negative the negative  force shall not be dammed up in  one alone, and conversely  that  if one only  is to be negative the negative force  shall not be free to spill over into the other. Some  classified  specimens of  failure to secure these essentials may put writers on their guard; the cor- rections appended are designed rather as  proofs of the error than as neces- sarily  the best emendations.

Neither  . . . or. 7.  Neither  as  conjunction.  8.  Neither pleonastic. 1.  The  pronunciation recommended is  m,  not  né;  see  EITHER. 2.  The  proper sense  of the  pronoun (or adjective)  is  'not  the one nor the other  of  the two*. Like  either,  it  some- times refers loosely  to  numbers greater than  two  (Heat, light,  electricity,  mag- netism,  are  all  correlatives;  neither  can be  said  to be the  essential cause  of  the others)  ; but  none  or  no  should  be pre- ferred;  cf.  EITHER  3.  This restriction to  two  does  not  hold  for the  adverb (Neither  fish nor flesh  nor  fowl). 3.  The  number  of the  adjective  and pronoun  is  properly singular,  and disregard  of  this fact  is a  recognized grammatical mistake, though,  with  the pronoun  at  least, very common:  The conception  is  faulty  for two  reasons, neither  of  which  are  noticed  by  Plato.  / What  at  present  I  believe neither  of  us know.  Grammar requires  is  noticed, and  knows.  The  same mistake  with  the adjective  is so  obviously wrong  as to be almost impossible  ; not  quite, how- ever:  Both  Sir  Harry Verney  and Mr. Gladstone  were  very brief,  neither speeches  exceeding  fifteen minutes.  An almost equally incredible freak  with the pronoun  is:  Lord  Hothfield  and Lord  Reay  were  born  the  one  in  Paris and  the  other  at  The  Hague,  neither being  British  subjects  at  the time  of  his birth  (as indeed neither could  be  unless he were twins). 4.  Number  and  person after  neither .  . .  nor.  If  both  subjects  are  singular and  in the  third person,  the  only need is  to  remember  that  the  verb must  be singular  and not  plural. This  is  often forgotten;  the OED  quotes, from Johnson,  Neither  search  nor  labour  are necessary,  and,  from Ruskin,  Neither painting  nor  fighting  feed  men,  where",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
neither,"387 is  and  feeds  are undoubtedly required; and we may still read in journals of the highest  standing, or hear from the B.B.C.,  such sentences as  Official quarters  in London are confident that neither  President  Eisenhower  nor Mr. Dulles  want an armed clash with China.  /  Comment in  Paris  is guarded as neither General de Gaulle nor the Foreign  Minister are  immediately  avail- able.  I  Neither Mr.  Gaitskell  nor Mr. Grimond  have  tried  to minimize the Russian  provocation  in Cuba.  The right course is not to indulge in bad grammar ourselves and  then plead  that  better  men like Johnson and Ruskin  have done it before us, but to follow  what is now the accepted as well as the  logical  rule. Complications occur when, owing to a difference in number or person between the subject of the  neither  member and that  of the  nor  member, the same verb- form or pronoun or  possessive  adjective does  not fit  both:  Neither you nor I (was?,  were?) chosen; Neither you nor I  (is?, am?,  are?)  the right person; Neither eyes nor nose (does  its?,  do their?)  work; Neither employer nor employees will say what (they want?, he wants  ?).  The wise man, in writing, evades  these problems by  ^ejecting  all the  alternatives—any  of  which  may set up friction between him and his reader —and  putting  the thing in some other shape;  and in speaking, which does not allow  time for paraphrase, he takes risks with  equanimity and  says  what instinct dictates. But, as instinct is directed largely  by habit, it is well to eschew habitually the clearly wrong forms (such as  Neither chapter nor  verse  are given)  and the clearly provocative ones (such as  Neither husband nor wife is competent  to act without  his  consort). About  the following, which are actual newspaper extracts, neither gramma- rians  nor laymen will be unanimous in  approving or disapproving the preference  of  is  to  are  or  of  has  to  have; but  there  will be a good majority for the opinion  that  both  writers are grammatically  more  valorous  than discreet:  Neither  apprenticeship  sys- tems  nor  technical  education  is  likely to",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

When  a negative has  preceded, a question often arises between  nor  and  or  as the right con- tinuation, and the answer to the ques- tion sometimes requires  care  ; see  NOR and  OR.  But when the  preceding  nega- tive is  neither  (adv.), the  matter  is sim- ple,  or  being always wrong. Examples of  the mistake:  Diderot  presented  a bouquet  which was  neither  well  or  ill received,  j Like the  Persian  noble  of old, I  ask  'that  I may  neither  command  or obey'.  Here  again,  to say  that  Morley and Emerson have sinned before us is a  plea not  worth  entering. 7.

But it is still fully  idiomatic where it links the speaker  with  some other person: Defendant  did  net  interfere;  neither did I. 8.

 in -ize.,"A feature of the second  Elizabethan age, as of the first, is  that  new words proliferate. One way of  making  them  is to add the suffix  -ize to a noun or adjective, and so increase our stock of verbs. The device itself is far  from new; our vocabulary already contains some hundreds of verbs so formed. The Greeks used the suffix Lt,€t.v  to make verbs  with,  and we have followed  them  ; sometimes we take over what is,  except  for its termination, an  actual Greek word  (apologize,  dog- matize,  ostracize,  etc.); sometimes we add  -ize  to a word or stem, usually of Greek or Latin origin  (colonize,  im- munize,  summarize,  etc.) but occasion- ally  of later date  (bastardize,  jeopardize, standardize,  etc.) especially to names 389",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 in -ize,"of  places or people  (americanize, bowdlerize,  galvanize,  pasteurize,  etc.). Within  reason it is a useful and unexceptionable device, but it is now being  employed  with  a  freedom beyond reason. The purpose is usually to enable us to say in one word what would otherwise need more than one. Whether  that  justifies the creation of a new  -ize  word is a question on which opinions will differ, and it does not admit of a categorical answer. Most verbs in  -ize  are inelegant. Sir  Alan  Herbert  has compared  them to lavatory fittings, useful in their proper place but not to be multiplied beyond what is necessary for practical purposes. (Perhaps it was this stricture that  led to the use of the word  In- throning  at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II instead of the word Inthronization  used at previous coro- nations.)  A different, and often prefer- able,  way of providing ourselves  with a  new verb is boldly to use a noun as one. We say to  doctor,  not to  doctorize, to  partition,  not to  partitionize;  if it was  necessary for us to have verbs for sending  people to hospital and for dividing  sleeping accommodation into cubicles,  we should have done  better to say to  hospital  and to  cubicle  than to coin  those ungainly words  hospitalize and  cubiclize.  Pressurize,  containerize, and  institutionalize  are useful but to treat  pressure,  container,  and  institu- tion  as verbs would have been  less clumsy.  The lure of the suffix is so powerful  that  we sometimes find it added absurdly to nouns whose use as verbs is already recognized, such as SERVICE  and  fragment,  CONTACT  used as  a verb excited some criticism at first, but even its critics would admit that  this was  better  than coining a verb  contactize.  And having sensibly invented the verb  delouse,  we ought to have nothing to do  with  the  deratize that  is now showing its  ugly  head. There are obvious limits to the use of this device for avoiding recourse to -ize  when we want a new verb. Adjec- tives take  less  kindly than nouns to being  made to serve as verbs and not all  nouns are suitable. It could for",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
new verbs in -ize,"instance be argued on behalf of  itiner- ize  that,  the natural verb  itinerate having  been put to a different use, it is a  better  one than to  itinerary  would be, with  its almost unpronounceable pres- ent participle, though this does not answer the criticism  that  since we already  have the verb to  route  we do not need either of  them.  A similar plea might be made for  diarize  on the ground of its inflexional advantages over to  diary.  If we must have words for  employing casual labour instead of regular,  or a civilian staff instead of a military, or for spoiling the  country- side  by extending a  town,  or for substituting diesel locomotives for steam, we cannot reasonably quar- rel  with  casualize, civilianize, sub- urbanize,  and  dieselize.  A recent ex- periment of this kind, seriously made in a serious journal, was to refer to  die comprehensivizing  by a local authority of  its educational system, a neologism that  certainly deserves high marks if the  test  of its merit is the number of words it  saves;  so would  deprole- tarianize  used by a speaker on the Third Programme, if we could be sure we knew  what  it meant. Lexi- cographers must be allowed their alphabetize  (they have indeed had it for   about a hundred  years),  and road engineers their  reflectorize,  and PUBLICIZE  can put up a good defence against  a charge of being merely an  unwanted synonym for  publish. Whether  randomize  can be similarly justified on the ground  that  no other word, such as  shuffle ox jumble,  would do,   and  whether  finalize  (which seems  to have come to stay in spite of the protest  that  greeted it) can claim to have a meaning not quite the same as  that  of  any  established word are arguable  questions. But few will deny that  trialize  and  reliablize  are  un- wanted monstrosities and when simple verbs like  proof   and  perfume  are available  we might have been spared impermeablize  and  fragrantize.

We may be expected to respond more readily to an  invitation  to  slenderize  than to  slim, to visit a  picturized  film than a  pictured one; if we want to 'repel the  signs  of age'  we shall be more likely to buy a  preparation  that  moisturizes  the skin than one  that  merely  moistens  it, and we shall find  tenderized  prunes more alluring  than those  that  are merely tender.  Some missionaries of moral uplift have the same idea. Of a book by one of  them  a TLS reviewer has written:  'Of course it is disconcerting to be told  that  a certain method is ""rather  unique"", and few people brought up in an older religious con- vention will find the formula ""Prayer- ize,  Picturize, Actualize"" of much help to  them  in the practice of meditation.

nor,"is a  word  that  should come into our minds  as we  repeat  the  General Confession.  Most  of us in our  time have left undone those things which we ought  to  have done  (i.e.  failed  to put in  nor  when  it was  wanted)  and done those things which  we  ought  not to have done  (i.e.  thrust  it in  when there  was no  room  for it). The  nega- tive forms  of  He  moves  and  speaks,  He both  moves  and  speaks,  are  He  moves not  nor  speaks,  He  neither moves  nor speaks',  or,  with  the  verb resolved  as is usual  in  modern negative sentences, He does  not  move  or  speak,  He  does  not either  move  or  speak.  The  tendency  to go  wrong  is  probably  due to  confusion between  the  simple verbs  (moves  etc.) and  the  resolved ones  (does  move  etc.); if  the  verb  is  resolved,  there  is  often an  auxiliary  that  serves  both  clauses, and,  as the  negative  is  attached  to the auxiliary,  its  force  is  carried  on together  with  that  of the  auxiliary and  no  fresh negative  is  wanted.  Two cautions  are  necessary  on  this carrying on  of  the negative force and consequent preference  of or to  nor.  The  first  is  that it will  not do to  repeat  the  auxiliary and  yet use  or  under  the  impression that  the  previous negative suffices; that  is  what  has  been done  in: He  was  naturally  and  properly  at pains  to  prove  that  his  company  had not  acted negligently  or  carelessly  or had  been unduly influenced  by  reasons of  economy  (There  was a  choice here between  or  been  and  and had not  been', or  had  been  makes nonsense"").

The following examples illustrate the  danger;  in each  or  must be corrected to  nor  if the rest of the sentence is to remain as  it is, though some slight change of arrangement such as is indicated would make  or  possible :  In this kind of  work there  was  often little  oral  preparation of  material, little systematic  collection of  facts and views, well  assimilated  and digested,  or much  discussion  of balance and  proportion.

 than.,"The OED  re- marks:  'The  combination  nothing less than  has two  quite  contrary senses', and gives as the first  'quite  equal to, the same thing as',  with,  for illustra- tion,  But yet methinks my  father's execution  Was nothing less  than  bloody tyranny,  and as the second 'far from being, any thing rather than',  with, for illustration,  Who,  trusting to the laws, expected n.  1.1.  an attack.  To the second sense it adds the description 'Now rare'. As a  matter  of grammar, either sense is legitimate,  less  being different parts of speech in the two, as appears in the light of paraphrases: my father's death was  no smaller thing than  tyranny (i.e.  less  is an adjective); they  expected  nothing in a lower  degree than  they expected  an attack (i.e.  less is  an  adverb);  grammar,  then,  leaves the  matter  open. But the risks of ambiguity are very great. If the sense of  they expected n.  I.  t. an attack  did not happen to be fixed by  trusting to the laws,  who would dare decide whether  they  expected  it very  much or very little? The sense called by the OED 'now rare' should, in the in- terests of plain expression, be made rarer by  total  abandonment; a speaker can show  what  he means by  n.  I.  t. by the way he  says  it, but a  writer cannot.

Some  twenty  years earlier this pheno- menon had provoked the following comment  in the first edition of the present dictionary: 'It will be a sur- prise, and to some an agreeable one, if  at this late stage in our change from an inflexional to an analytic language we revert to a free use of the case  that we formerly  tended  more and more to restrict.

But to the present (or perhaps already past) generation, which has been instinc- tively aware of differences  between drink's victims  and  the victims of drink, and now finds  them  scornfully dis- regarded,  there  will be an unhappy interim.

 spelling.,"When there is both  noun  and  verb work  to be  done by  a  word,  and the  plan  of  forming a  noun from  the  verb,  or a  verb from the noun,  by  adding  a  formative suffix (as  in  stealth  from  steal)  is  not  followed, the  one  word  may  be called  on  to double the parts.  In  that  case there  is a  strong tendency  to  differentiate  by  pronun- ciation,  as in  use  (n.  ûs,  v.  ûz);  such  a distinction  is  sometimes,  as in  use,  un- recorded  in  spelling,  but  sometimes recorded  as in  calf  and  calve.  It is not possible  to  draw  up a  complete list  of the words affected, because the impulse is  still active,  and the  list would need constant additions, especially  of  words whose pronunciation  can be  modified without  change  of  spelling.  But, as this means  that  the  pronunciation  of  many words  is for a  time uncertain,  a  slight analysis  of a  fair number  of  examples may  help those  who are in  doubt.  It can  be  laid down,  to  start with,  that DIFFERENTIATION  is in  itself  an aid to lucidity,  and  therefore  that,  when  one does  not  suspect oneself  of  being  the innovator,  and the  only question  is between accepting  and  rejecting  a  dis- tinction initiated  by  others, acceptance is  wisdom. 1.

There are  also a  few words in which some speakers shift the accent, and others go half way  by  giving  the last syllable of the verb  with  a clear instead of an obscure vowel; so complement, compliment, experiment, implement,  etc. 2.  Other  words, especially  mono- syllables,  are differentiated not by accent but by a modification in noun or verb of the consonantal sound at the end, which is hard in the noun and soft in the verb. This difference is often for the ear only and does not affect  spelling; so abuse,  betroth  (un- like  troth),  close (hard  s  in  cathedral close),  excuse,  grease,  house, misuse, mouse,  mouth.  In this  class,  as in the classes  in the preceding paragraph, are words about which usage varies. More often the change of sound is recorded in  the spelling, and about such words no doubts  arise;  but examples are worth  giving  to confirm the fact  that the distinguishing of the parts of speech by  change of sound is very common, and  that  its extension is natural to words whose spelling  fails  to show it.

Anyone can say  surroundings  and combination  and  total;  I will say  am- bience  and  synthesis  and  overall.

The reading aloud  of  poetry  or  prose,  or speaking them by  heart,  compel  the student to study  their meaning  closely.  /  United Nations  troops  in the Congo have been ordered  to  shoot  if life or  property  are in danger.  When  both  alternatives are singular  in grammar and in sense the verb can only be singular. These quo- tations, one from an educational pam- phlet  and  the other  from  a  news agency, show how  easy  it is to blunder into a plural. (For the same mistake  with neither...  nor  see  NEITHER  4.) But when the alternatives differ in number, as in Mother  or children are to die, Is the child  or the parents to be blamed?,  the methods in order of merit are: (a)  Evade by  finding  a verb of com- mon number :  Mother or  children  must die,  Shall  the child or the parents be blamed?',  (b)  Invoke ellipsis by chang- ing  the order:  The mother is to die, or the  children.  Is the child to be blamed, or  the  parents?;  (c) Give the verb the number of the alternative nearest it: Mother  or children are to die, Is the child  or the parents to be blamed? 4.  Red herrings. Some writers are as  easily  drawn off the scent as young hounds. They start  with  a singular subject; before they reach the verb, a plural noun attached to an  of  or some other similar distraction happens to cross,  and off they go in the plural; or vice  versa. This is a  matter  of careless- ness  or inexperience only, and needs no discussion; but it is so common as to call for a few illustrations:  This argument  for Mr.  Macmillan's  attend- ing  the Assembly does not alter the irk- some  fact that he, in common with President  Eisenhower, are dancing to Mr. Khrushchev's tune.  /  The  results  of the  recognition  of this truth is  ... /  The foundation  of politics are in the letter only.

Harking back  with  relatives.  Who, which,  and  that,  can in themselves be singular  or plural, and  there  is  a par- ticular form of sentence in which this produces constant blunders.  He is one of  the  best  men that have ever lived  (with which compare  He is one that has lived honestly).  In the first sentence  there are two words capable of serving as antecedent to  that,  viz.  one  (as in the bracketed sentence) and  men.  A  mo- ment's thought shows  that  men  is the antecedent necessary to the sense : Of the best men  that  have ever lived (or of  the best past and present men) he is  one. But  with  one  and  men  (or  their equivalents)  to attach the relative to, writers will hark  back  to  one  in spite of  the nonsense it  gives,  and make their verbs singular:  He is another of  the numerous  people  who  is  quite competent  in the art of turning what he has  to say into rhyme and metre.  / Vaughan Williams is one of  those  con- temporary  composers  who does not  feel the  need  for a new  medium.  /  Detective- inspector  J.

The Cabinet  is divided  is  better,  because in the order of  thought  a whole  must  precede division;  and  The  Cabinet  are  agreed is  better,  because it takes two or more to agree.  That  is a delicate distinction, and few will be at the pains to make it. Broader  ones  that  few will fail to know are  that  between  The army  is  on a voluntary  basis  and  The army  are  above the  average  civilian height,  and  that  be- tween  The party lost  their  hats  and The party lost  its  way.  In general it may be said  that  while  there  are always  a  better  and a worse in the matter,  there  are seldom a right and a  wrong, and any  attempt  to elaborate rules would be waste labour. But if the decision  whether  a noun of  multitude  is to be  treated  as a  singular or as a plural is often a  difficult business, and  when  ill made results at worst in a venial blemish, failure to abide by the choice  when made, and plunging  about  between it  and  they, have  and  has, its  and  their, and the like, can only be called insults to the reader. A waiter might as well serve one on a dirty plate as a journal- ist offer one such untidy stuff as :  The University  of London  Press  hopes  to have ready the following additions to their  series  of  ... /  The Times also gives  some  interesting  comments  by  their special  correspondent.  /  During  their  six years  of  office  the Government  has  done great  harm,  j The village  is  at  work  now and ready to do  their  bit.  /  When  the generation  which  participated, and which was  represented  at yesterday afternoon's affair,  have  gone  .  . . /  With  their children's  programme  the  B.B.C.  never puts  a  foot  wrong. (b)  There  are  heaps  more  to say, but I  must not tax your  space  further.  The plurals  heaps  and  lots  used collo- quially  for a great  amount  now always take a singular verb unless  a  plural noun  with  of  is added :  There  is  heaps of  ammunition,  but  There are heaps of cups;  There is lots to do,  but  Lots of people  think  so.  Compare the use of half  in  Half of it  is  rotten,  but  Half of  them  are  rotten. (c)  When  the word  number  is itself the subject it is a safe rule to  treat  it as  singular  when  it has a definite article and as plural  when  it has an indefinite.  The number of  people  present was  large,  but  A  large  number of  people were  present.  In  Before  the conclave begins  in a fortnight's time a number of details has to be settled  the singular is clearly  wrong; it is the details  that have to be settled not the  number;  a number of  details  is a composite subject equivalent to  numerous details.  This use of  a number of  in the sense of more than  one but not a great many is idiomatic, but the almost absurd vagueness  of the expression if inter- preted  literally makes careful writers prefer an adjective such as  some, several,  many, numerous;  this has the advantage too of leaving no  doubt  that the verb  must  be plural. 7.  Singular  verb preceding plural subject and vice versa. The excuse for this in  speaking—often  a sufficient one—is  that  one has started one's sentence before fixing the precise form of  the subject, though its meaning may have been realized clearly enough. But the  writer  both  can and ought to do what  the speaker cannot, correct his first words before the wrong version has  reached his audience. If he does not, he too, like the waiter  with  the dirty plate (see 6 (a)), is indecently and insultingly  careless. Examples:  For the first time there  is  introduced into the Shipyard  Agreement  clauses  which hold the balance equally.  /  A  book  entitled 'America's  Day', by  Ignatius  Phayre, in which  is  discussed the  pressing  prob- lems  of  home  and  foreign  policy that ...j On these questions there  is  likely to be acute  differences  among the political groups  and parties.  /  Where only three years  ago was pasture land now  stands vast  engineering  shops, miles  of railway sidings,  and the constant  hum  of machinery.

The alteration of  were  to  was  would now be an  improvement;  but why, if were  was best in the bare framework given  first?   How has the author elaborated it? First and least, he has  made table and chairs  less  homo- geneous,  less  the equivalent of 'some articles  of furniture', by describing one as plain deal and the others as wicker; secondly, he has attached to chairs  and not to  table  a long relative clause;  third and most important, in order to cut off the relative clause from  table  he has had to shift  in  there to an earlier place. The result is  that the verbal phrase  (there  were  . . . in there)  is so arranged  that  it encloses one item of the compound subject (table) and leaves the other (chairs) out in  the cold.

No one who can help it chooses the first; it is correct, and is sometimes necessary, but it is so clumsy as to be ridiculous except when explicitness is urgent, and it usually sounds like a bit of pedantic humour. The second is the popular solution; it sets the literary man's  teeth on edge, and he exerts himself to  give the same meaning in some entirely different way if he is not prepared to risk  the third, which is here recom- mended.

obdurate,"O -o-  is a connecting vowel of Greek origin,  its extended modern function being  so to shape the end of a Greek or Latin word  that  when a suffix or another word is applied to it the two will coalesce recognizably into a  single derivative or compound. Three points should be noticed:   1.  The  part ending  in  -0-  is not a word, even though it might be used by itself as a curtailed one  (hydro,  photo,  etc.) In the com- pound it is essentially the beginning only  of a  word  ;  We owe it to the genius of  Hertz that we are now  able  to  measure directly  the velocity of  electro and magnetic  waves  ;  electro  is  there  used as an  adjective instead  of  electric,  and is  in- defensible.  2. The words fit for the  -0- treatment  are, if not necessarily authentic ancient Greek or Latin, at least  such as may pass for Greek or Latin.  If the ancient Romans did not call  the Russians  Russi  or talk of America  and  Americani,  we can sup- pose  that  was only because they had not the chance, and we are therefore entitled to make  Russo-,  Americo-,  and Americano-.   But the Greeks and Romans  did know what speed was, and no one supposes they called it speed,  whence it follows  that  speedo- and  speedometer  are  'barbaric'  forma- tions.  3. It is not enough  that  the word to be treated should be actual or possible Latin or Greek; the shaping must be done in the right way.  We must take account of  rcligio-philosophic speculations  with  regard  to the nature of  Eternal Life;  Latin, it is  true,  has both  religio  and  religiosus,  but only the second  admits of the  -0-  treatment, and it  gives  religioso-philosophic.

object-shuffling.,"The  conferring  of a  name on  a  type of mistake, making  it recognizable  and  avoidable,  is  worth while if the mistake is common.  Object- shuffling  describes what unwary writers are  apt to do  with  some  of  the many verbs  that  require, besides  a  direct object, another noun bearing  to  them a  somewhat similar relation,  but at- tached  to  them  by  a  preposition. You can  inspire courage  in a  person,  or inspire  a  person  with  courage;  the change  of  construction  is  object- shuffling,  which,  with  the verb  inspire, is  legitimate  and  does  not  offend against  idiom.  But  with  instil  the object-shuffling would  be  wrong; you can  instil courage into  a  person;  to instil  a  person  with  courage is contrary to idiom. Wherever reference  is  made under  any  word  to  this article,  the meaning is  that  with  that  word object- shuffling  is not  permissible. Most  of the verbs liable  to  this maltreatment are  derived from Latin verbs com- pounded  with  prepositions and there- fore  beginning  with  in-, sub-, pre-,  etc. The Latin scholar, aware  that  the verbal parts  of  substituo  and  instillo  and praefigo  mean  to put  and  to  pour and",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

(2)  Even when  the word might bear  its  true  sense  of forgetful  (as  opposed  to  unaware),  it is often followed  by the  wrong preposi- tion  (to).  This  is a  natural result  of the misuse  explained  in  (1);  it  will  be noticed  that  two of the  three  quota- tions  there  given show  to  instead  of  of, perhaps  on the  analogy  of  insensible  to. But  in the  following examples  to  has been used even where  the  meaning might otherwise  be the  correct  one of forgetful  :  Each  of  them  oblivious  to the presence  of  anybody  else,  and  intent  on conversation.  /  A  principle  to  which  the romances  of  the  eighteenth  century  were curiously  oblivious.  /  Mr.  Humphreys  is always oblivious  to the  fact that  the minority  in  one part  of the  kingdom  is represented  by the  majority  in  another part. The making  of  these mistakes  is  part of  the  price paid  by  those  who  reject the homely word, avoid  the  obvious, and  look about  for the  imposing. Forgetful,  unaware,  unconscious,  un- mindful,  and  heedless,  while they usually  give  the  meaning more  pre- cisely,  lay  no  traps.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

See  m,  Œ. The following spellings  of words beginning  with  oe or its substitutes are recommended: ecology  etc.; ecumenical; oedema etc.; Oedipus; oesophagus; oestrum. The pronunciation in all is simply  ë. -o(e)s. The Englishman has a legiti- mate grievance against the words in  -o. No one who is not prepared to flout usage  and say  that  for him every word in  -0  shall make  -oes,  or all shall make -os,  can possibly escape doubts; one kind of whole-hogger will have to  write heros  and  cargos  and  potatos  and  gos  and negros,  while the other kind must face embryoes,  photoes,  cameoes,fiascoes,  and generalissimoes.  In this  book,  many words in  -0  have been entered in their dictionary places  with  the plurals  that seem advisable; here, one or two guiding  principles may be tentatively suggested.  Although  there  are several hundred  nouns in  -0,  the ending is one  that  is  generally  felt to be exotic, and only  a small minority are allowed the plural in  -oes,  which, since it is invari- able  in  many very familiar words  (no,go, cargo,  potato,  hero,  negro,  etc.) might be considered the normal form. It must be understood  that  the following rules are not more than generally  true, and  that  sometimes they come to blows  with  each other over a word, and that  such battles may remain long undecided. 1.  Words used as freely in the plural as  in the singular usually have  -oes, though  there  are very few  with  which it is invariable ; names of animals and plants  fall  naturally into this  class.  So banjoes;  bravoes;  cargoes;  dingoes; dominoes  ;  flamingoes  ;  heroes;  potatoes. 2.  Monosyllables take  -oes;  so  goes, noes. 3.  Words of the kind whose plural is  seldom wanted or is restricted to special  uses have  -os;  so  dos  (the musical   note);   crescendos;  dittos; guanos;  infernos;  lumbagos. 4.  When  a vowel precedes the -0, -os  is usual, perhaps because of the bizarre look of  -toes  etc.; so  arpeggios; bagnios;  cameos;  embryos  ;  folios  ;  punc- tilios. 5.  The curtailed words made by dropping the second element of a compound or the later syllables have -os;  so  chromos;  dynamos; magnetos; photos;  pros;  stylos. 6. Alien-looking or otherwise queer words have  -os;  so  albinos; alto- relievos;   centos;   commandos; duo- decimos;  fiascos;  ghettos;  lingos;  medi- cos;  negrillos. 7.   Long words  tend  to  -os;  so archipelagos  (or   -oes);  armadillos; generalissimos;  manifestos. 8. Proper names have  -os;  so  Gallios; Lotharios;  Neros;  Romeos. of. This preposition shares  with another word of the same length,  AS, the evil glory of being accessary to more crimes against grammar than any  other.  But, in contrast  with  the syntax of  as,  which is so difficult  that blunders are very excusable,  that  of of  is  so simple  that  only  gross  careless- ness  can lead anyone astray  with  it. Nevertheless, straying is perpetual, and the impression of amateurishness produced on an educated reader of the newspapers is discreditable to the English  Press.  Fortunately, the com- monest type of blunder  with  of  is very definite and recognizable, so  that  the setting of it forth  with  sufficient illus- tration has a real chance of working some improvement.  That  type is treated in the first of the following sections,  the list of which is :  (1)  Wrong patching; (2) Patching the unpatch- able;  (3) Side-slip; (4) Irresolution; (5)  Needless repetition; (6) Misleading omission;  (7) Some freaks of idiom. 1.

GUAGE.,"7.  Some freaks of idiom.  You are the  man  of all others  that I did not suspect.  He is the  worst  liar  of any man /  know. A child  of  ten years  old. That  long  nose  of  his.  The modern tendency is to rid speech of  patent ILLOGICALITIES;  and  all  the   above either are, or seem to persons ignorant of  any justification  that  might be found in the history of the constructions, plainly  illogical:  the man of all  men; the worst liar of  all liars;  a child  of  ten years ,  or a child  ten years  old;  a  friend of  mine, i.e. among my friends, but surely  not  that  nose  of his, i.e. among his  noses : so the logic-chopper is fain to correct or damn; but even he is likely  in unguarded moments to let the forbidden phrases slip out. Some will perhaps be disused in time; meanwhile they are recognized  idioms—STURDY INDEFENSIBLES  possibly, though not without  their defenders. Jespersen, for  instance, has shown  that  the use of of  in such constructions as  A child of ten years old  and  That  long  nose  of his is  as old as Caxton, and has argued that  of is  here not partitive but apposi- tional—merely  a grammatical device to make it possible to join words which for  some reason or another it would otherwise be impossible to join. The latter  construction may be found in the opening lines  of  Antony and Cleopatra: *Nay  but this dotage of  our  general's o'erflows the measure'. officialese  is  a pejorative  term  for a  style of writing marked by peculiari- ties supposed to be characteristic of officials.  If a  single  word were needed to describe those  peculiarities,  that chosen by Dickens,  circumlocution,  is still  the most suitable. They may  be ascribed  to a combination of causes: a  feeling  that  plain words sort ill  with the dignity of office, a politeness  that shrinks  from  blunt  statement, and, above all, the knowledge  that  for those engaged  in the perilous game of politics,  and their servants, vagueness is  safer than precision. The natural result is a stilted and verbose style, not readily  intelligible—a  habit of mind for instance  that  automatically rejects the  adjective  unsightly  in favour of the  PERIPHRASIS  detrimental to  the visual amenities of the locality. This reputation, though not al- together undeserved, is unfairly exag- gerated by a confusion in the public mind between  officialese  and  what  may be termed   legalese.   For instance a  correspondent writes to  The Times to show up  what  he  calls  this 'flower of  circumlocution' from the National Insurance Act  1959;  it ought not, he says,  to be allowed to waste its sweet- ness  on the desert air.  For the  purpose of  this Part of this  Schedule  a  person over  pensionable  age,  not being an in- sured  person,  shall be treated as an insured  person  if he  would  be an insured person  were  he  under  pensionable  age and would  be an employed  person  were  he an insured  person. This is certainly not  pretty  or lumi- nous  writing. But  it  is not officialese, nor is it circumlocution. It is  legalese, and the reason why it is difficult to grasp  is not  that  it wanders verbosely round the  point  but  that  it goes straight  there  with  a baffling economy of  words. It has the compactness of a  mathematical formula.   Legalese cannot be judged by literary standards. In it everything must be subordinated to one paramount purpose:  that  of ensuring  that  if words have to be interpreted by a  Court  they will be given  the meaning the draftsman in- tended.

Grammar is a poor despised branch of  learning; if it were  less  despised, we should not have such frequent occasion  to weep or laugh at the pitiful wrigglings of those who feel themselves in the toils of this phrase. That  the victims know their plight is  clear from the way they dart in different directions to find an  outlet. Here are half a  dozen  attempts,  all failures,  but each  distinguishable  in some  point  of arrangement from the rest: (a)  Given in the Costume  Hall — one  of, if not the most,  spacious  of  salons for  dresses  and  costumes — the  dancing has  been  ...  (b) One of the finest, if not the  finest, poem of an equal length pro- duced  of  recent  years,  (c)  /  think the stage  is  one of, if not the best of all, professions  open to  women,  (d) Fur was one  of the  greatest — perhaps  the  greatest — export  articles of  Norway,  (e) The Japanese  were  one of the  most,  if not the most,  enterprising  nations in the East. (/)  One of, if not, the oldest  Voortrek- kers  of South Africa has just  passed away. The nature of the problem is this: we have two expressions of the type 'one  of the best books' and 'the best book'; but we have been taught to avoid  repetition of words, and there- fore desire  that  part  of one of these nearly  similar expressions should be understood instead of said or  written. Let us  then  enclose the partially expressed one inside the  other,  as a  parenthesis. Can this be  done?  It will be  seen  that  (a),  (b),  and (c), though they differ in minor points, are alike in failing  to pass the most obvious  test— does the enclosing expression read right if the parenthesis is left out?  One of  spacious  of salons, One of the finest poem,  One  ofprofessions  open to women: the first and second  nonsense,  the third the wrong sense. In  (d) s  (e),  (  / ), the enclosing expression taken alone does give sense; the further  test  they have to pass  is—if  the words under- stood in the parenthesis are  written  in, does the whole read as sound,  though perhaps inelegant,  English?

The rule  that  has been broken in the supposed compressions  (d), (e),  (/), and not broken in the real one, is  that you cannot understand out of a word that  is yet to come another word (as article  out of a coming  articles, nation out of a coming  nations, Voortrekker out of a coming  Voortrekkers),  but only  the same word, as  orator  out of orator.  When,  as always happens in this idiom,  there  is a change of num- ber, the only thing is to see  that  the place  from  which the understood word is  omitted  is after, not before, the word from which it is to be supplied; for  from a word  that  has already been expressed the taking of the other num- ber is not forbidden.

It is  pointed out in several parts of this book  that  illogicalities  and inaccuracies of  expression  tend  to be eliminated as a  language grows older and its users attain to a more conscious mastery of",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
only,"419 their materials. But this tendency has its bad as well as its good effects; the pedants who try to forward it when the illogicality is only apparent or the inaccuracy  of no importance are  turn- ing  English into an exact science or an automatic machine. If they are not quite  botanizing  upon  their  mother's grave,  they are at least clapping a strait waistcoat  upon  their  mother  tongue, when wiser physicians would refuse to certify the  patient. The design is to force us all, when- ever we use the adverb  only,  to spend time  in considering which is the pre- cise  part  of the sentence strictly quali- fied by it, and  then  put it  there—this irrespective of  whether  there  is any danger  of the meaning's being false or ambiguous because  only  is so placed as to belong grammatically to a whole expression instead of to a  part  of it, or as  to be separated from the  part  it specially  qualifies. It may at once be admitted  that  there is  an orthodox placing for  only,  but it does not follow  that  there  are not often good  reasons for departing from ortho- doxy. For  He only died a week ago  no better  defence is perhaps possible than that  it is the  order  that  most people have always used and still use, and  that, the risk of misunderstanding being chimerical, it is not  worth  while to depart  from the natural. Remember that  in speech  there  is not even the possibility  of misunderstanding, be- cause  the intonation of  died  is entirely different if it, and not  a week ago,  is qualified by  only,  and it is fair  that a  reader should be supposed capable of  supplying the decisive intonation where  there  is no  temptation  to go wrong  about  it. But take  next  an example in which, ambiguity being practically possible, the case against heterodox  placing is  much  stronger: Mackenzie  only  seems  to go  wrong  when he  lets in yellow; and yellow  seems  to be still  the standing difficulty of the  colour printer.  The orthodox place for  only is  immediately before  when,  and the antithesis  between  seeming to go and really  going, which, though not in- tended, is apt to suggest itself, makes",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 too,"the displacement here ill advised. Its motive, however, is  plain—to  an- nounce the limited nature of the wrong before the wrong itself, and so mitigate the censure: a  quite  sound rhetorical instinct, and, if  goes  had been used instead of  seems to go,  a sufficient defence of the heterodoxy. But  there are many sentences in which, owing to greater length, it is  much  more urgent to get this announcement of purport  made by an advanced  only.  For instance, the orthodox  It would be safe to  prophesy  success  to this  heroic  enter- prise  only if reward and merit always corresponded  positively cries out to have its  only  put early after  would,  and un- less  that  is done the hearer or reader is  led  astray;  yet the precisian is bound to insist on orthodoxy here as  much as  in  He died only a week ago. The advice offered is this :  there  is an orthodox position for the adverb,  easily determined in case of need; to choose another position  that  may spoil or obscure the meaning is bad; but a change  of position  that  has no such effect  except  technically is not only justified by historical and colloquial usage  but often demanded by rhetori- cal  needs.

Writers  and printers should make up their minds  whether  there  is such a preposition as  onto  or not.

There are sentences in which it affects neither meaning nor correctness  whether  or  or  nor  is used. /  can neither read nor write  requires nor.  I cannot either read or write requires  or.  But in /  cannot read nor (or  or) write  we may use either. The alternatives in the last are differently arrived at, but are practically equiva- lent: /  cannot read, nor  (can I)  write ; I  cannot  read(-)or{-)write,  where the supposed hyphens mean  that  write may  be substituted for  read  if desired. The use of  nor  in such cases was formerly in fashion, and  that  of  or  is now in fashion;  that  is all. But the modern preference for  or  where it is equally  legitimate  with  nor  has led to its being preferred  also  where  it is illegitimate  ;  so :  It is of  great  impor- tance  that  they  should face them  in no academic spirit, or  trust too much to conclusions  drawn from maps.  /  No Government  Department or any other Authority has assisted.  The  test  of legitimacy  has been explained in  NOR; and it suffices here to say  that  what rules out  or  in the first extract is the position  of  no  (alter to  they should not face  them in any),  and in the second it is the presence of  any  (precluding the carrying on of  no). 2.  Number,  pronouns, etc., after  or. When  the subject is a set of alterna- tives each in the singular the verb must be singular however many the alternatives, and however long the sentence; in the extract below,  account should be  accounts;  for discussion see NUMBER  3:  Either the call of patriotism and the opportunity of  seeing  new lands, or  conscription,  or  the  fact that tramping was  discouraged  even by old patrons when the call for men became urgent, account  for it.  If the alternatives differ  in number or person, the nearest prevails  {Wereyou  or he, was he or  you,  there?',  either he or you  were, either  you or he was),  but some forms (e.g.   Was I or you on duty?)  are avoided by inserting a second verb {Was  I on  duty  or  were  you ?).  Forms in which difference of gender causes difficulty  with  pronouns  {A  landlord  or landlady expects their, his or her, his, rent)  are usually avoided,  their rent  or the  rent due to them  being ungram- matical (see  THEY  I),  his or her rent  or the  rent due to him or her  clumsy, and his rent  or  the rent due to him  puzzling; some evasion, as  expects rent,  or  the rent,  is always possible. 3.  Or  in enumerations.  I never heard a  sermon that was simpler, sounder, or dealt with  more  practical matters.  In the very numerous sentences made on this bad  pattern  there  is a confusion between two correct ways of  saying  the thing, viz. (a)  that was  simpler,  sounder, or  more  practical,  (b)  that was simpler or  sounder or dealt with  more  practical matters.  See  ENUMERATION,  and for full  discussion  AND  2. The abundant illustration of the latter makes similar quotations here needless. 4.  Wrong repetition after  or.  A mis- guided  determination  to be very explicit and leave no  opening  for  doubt results in a type of mistake illustrated in the article  OVERZEAL.  It is peculiarly common  with  or,  and to put writers on their guard a number of examples follow.  False  analogy from  and  ex- plains  it;  with  and,  it does not  matter whether  we say  without  falsehood  and deceit  or  without  falsehood  and without deceit,  except  that  the latter conveys a  certain sledge-hammer emphasis; but  with  or  there  is much difference between  without  falsehood  or deceit (which  implies  that  neither is present) and  without  falsehood  or without deceit (which implies only  that  one of the two is  not present). In all the examples except  the last, either  or  must be changed  to  and,  or the word or words repeated after  or  must be cut out; in the last example,  if  or  is to be retained, it will be necessary, besides omitting the second  no,  to change  one  to  person.

Another type  of  wrong repetition after  or,  not  accidental  but  deliberate, has  of  late been much favoured  by writers  of  popular tales, especially  in describing  the  cogitations  of  their characters.  This consists of a rhetorical question followed  by  another question posed  as  an  alternative  to the  first  but in  fact  a  repetition  of  it.  Hadn't he,  in her,  the  truth  he had  been  seeking?  Or hadn't he?  /  Was this  an  important clue that should be  followed  up  at  once?  Or was  it?

Whatever  the pur- pose,  it is the  kind  of  conceit  that  is unlikely  to  outlast  its  freshness. -or  is the  Latin agent-noun ending corresponding  to the  English  -er; compare  doer  and  perpetrator.  Eng- lish  verbs derived from  the  supine stem  of  Latin  ones—i.e.  especially most verbs  in  -ate,  but  also  many others such  as  oppress,  protect,  act, credit,  possess,  invent,   prosecute — usually  prefer this Latin form  to the  English  one in  -er.  Some other verbs,  e.g.  govern,  conquer,  and  purvey, not  corresponding  to the  above  de- scription have agent nouns  in  -or owing  to  their  passage  through French or other circumstances  that  need  not here  be set  forth.  A few odd  differ- ences  may  be of  interest :  decanter  and castor',  digester  and  collector',  corrupter and  corrector;  deserter  and  abductor; eraser  and  ejector;  promoter  and  abet- tor.  Some verbs have alternative forms  ; generally  preferring  -er  for the per- sonal  and  -or  for the  mechanical agent  (e.g.  adapt, convey,  distribute,  re- sist),  or  -or  for the  lawyers  and  -er  for ordinary  use  (e.g.  settle,  pay,  devise, vend). oral.

If they had decided for  others,  they would have been more in  tune  with  modern usage ; to say they would have chosen more correctly is hardly  possible:  The Unionist Party will do well to  remember  that the wreck- ing  policy is, like  other  of their adven- tures  in  recent  times, a dangerous gamble.  /  We find  here,  as in  other  of his novels, that he has no  genius  for ...  / Mrs.   will,  we  hope,  incite  other of  her  countrymen  and  countrywomen  to similar  studies.  /  We  were  quite  prepared for  the most  rigid  prohibition of trade with Germany; so was  France  and  other of  our Allies.  /  A Privy  Councillorship, an  honour  which has but rarely  been  won by  other  than  those  who  were  British subjects  from the moment of their birth. In four of these we have  what  the OED  calls  the absolute use of the adjective,  the noun represented by other  being present elsewhere in the sentence, but not expressed  with  other {like  other adventures of the adventures etc. would be the fully expressed forms);  in the fifth we have the full pronoun use,  other  meaning  other persons,  and  persons  not being expressed either  with  other  or elsewhere. But in both  uses the OED describes the plural  other  as archaic, and the plural others  as the regular modern form. In older  English,  however,  other  was normal in such contexts, so  that  those who like the archaic can justify  them- selves.  And since the OED was pub- lished  others  itself has been falling out of  fashion for the absolute use; a modern  writer  will probably feel  that neither  other  nor  others  is idiomatic: he will avoid the absolute use of the adjective and  fall  back on the usage re- ferred  to in OF 7 as a  STURDY  IN- DEFENSIBLE— like  other adventures of theirs,  in other novels of his, other",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The exis- tence of an adverbial use of  other  is recognized  by the OED, but sup- ported  by very few quotations, and those from no authors whose names carry  weight; its recent development may  be heartily condemned as  both ungrammatical and needless. In each of  the following quotations it will be seen  that  the phrase on the other side of  than  is adverbial like  otherwise,  and not adjectival like  other.  In the article OTHERWISE  the converse mistake is shown to be at least equally common. Both  mistakes are as stupid as they are common; and, though the substitution of  otherwise  for  other  or vice versa re- moves the blunder, it would usually be  better  to use neither  other than nor  otherwise  than,  but some different expression.

But  simple confusion between  other and  otherwise  does not account for every  bad  other than.  A notion seems to prevail  that  one exhibits refinement or verbal resource or some such ac- complishment if one can contrive an  other-than  variant for what would naturally be expressed by some other negative  form of speech:  could  not leave  0. t.  restless  is thought  superior  in literary  tone to could not but leave restless  ;  be other than flattered  to help being  flattered;  0. t.when Parliament was sitting  to when Parliament was not sitting; so:  Four  years of war  could not  leave a  people  o. t. restless. /  Mr. Collier  has  some  faults to find, but no Englishman  can be o. t. flattered  by the picture  which he paints of British activi- ties.

One or two of these are justifiable, while one is cer- tainly  not, from the grammarian's point of view; regarded as ornaments, they are clearly of no great value. On the whole,  other than  should be re- gistered  as a phrase to be avoided except  where it is  both  the most natural way of  putting  the thing and grammatically  defensible.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
otherwise,"has recently been having very  curious  experiences—emphati- cally  has recently,  because, while the OED originally showed no trace  what- ever of the two uses to be illustrated below,  both  of  them  have become so common  that  probably no one ever reads  his newspaper through  without meeting  them  and the OED Supp. had to add to its definitions  'after  a noun, adjective or adverb followed by  or: equivalent to a noun, adjective or adverb having an opposite or different meaning'.  Being  itself an adverb, it can  of course properly be so used  with another adverb  (He  decided,  sensibly  or 0., to take a  chance).  What  we are here concerned  with  is the popular exten- sion  of this usage to adjectives and nouns.  Whether  this popularity is a sign  of lately developed indispen- sability,  or merely a new example of the speed  with  which a  trick  of bad English  can be spread by fashion, it is hard to say  with  confidence; but, as one use is a definite outrage on gram- matical principles, and the other not very  easy  to reconcile  with  them,  we may  perhaps hope  that  they are freaks of  fashion only. The first is the ungrammatical use of the adverb  otherwise  when the adjec- tive or pronoun  other  would be correct;",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

otherwise,"cf.  OTHER  for the converse mistake. Comment will be  better  reserved till the reader has seen some examples: This  reduction in total expenditure has been  made concurrently with certain increases —automatic  and  otherwise— in particular items.  /  There are  large tracts  of the  country,  agricultural and otherwise,  in which the Labour writ does  not run.  J  No further threats, economic or otherwise,  have been made.  /  This  is a common incident in all warfare,  industrial or otherwise. / No  organizations,  religious or  other- wise,  had  troubled  to take the matter up.  I  An advisory council  composed entirely  of  those  persons,  musicians or otherwise,  who have had a genuine acquaintance  with  operatic  tradition. An apology may fairly be expected for  presenting so long a string of monotonous examples. The apology is  that,  before asking writers and speakers to give up a favourite habit, one should convince  them  that  it is their habit.  That  the habit is a  bad  one needs no  demonstration;  but it is worth  while  to  consider how it has come into existence, and  whether abstention from it is really a serious inconvenience. In all the above quota- tions, the structure is the  same—an adjective (or descriptive noun) deferred till after its noun and followed by an and  or an  or  joining to it the adverb otherwise.  Now,  what  should possess anyone,  under those circumstances, to match the adjective  with  otherwise instead of  other}  Is it not (far-fetched as  the explanation may seem)  that  the old  saying  'Some  men are wise and some are  otherwise'  once struck the popular consciousness as witty, and has  incidentally inspired a belief  that otherwise,  and not  other,  is the natural parallel  to an adjective? The justifica- tion of the proverb's own wording is simple—that  it is a pun, and  that  puns treat  grammar  as  love treats locksmiths, with  derision. A pun, however, and still  more the faded memory of a pun, is  a bad basis for a general idiom. Nor is  there  any difficulty whatever in abstaining  from this bit of bad gram- mar. It is  true  that  things have now reached the stage when many people feel  that  to change the popular  other' wise  to the correct  other  is sometimes pedantic;  but it is only sometimes, and there  are other resources. The above examples  would none of  them  be  less natural if the offending expression were  rewritten  thus  :  certain  automatic and other  increases — some  agricultural and  some  not — -no  further  economic  or other  threats — industrial  or non-indus- trial — religious  or  non-religious.  In correcting, the simple change of  other- wise  to  other  has been avoided, though in fact the critic who would cry 'pedantry'  at it must be a little crazy on the subject. And when  other  would be not an adjective but a pronoun, as in the last example, the change is natural and  obvious— those  persons, musicians  and  others. In the second use now to be depre- cated, the word to which  otherwise  sup- plies  the parallel is not an  adjective  but a  noun.Take the  three  forms  :  What  con- cerns  us is his  solvency;  What  concerns us is his solvency or insolvency;  What concerns  us is his solvency or  otherwise. Most of the sentences in which  or  other- wise  answers to a noun are of this type, and it makes no appreciable difference to the meaning and effect which of the three  forms is chosen. The  first  and the second are as much and as little different  in  most contexts as  Are you ready?  is different from  Are  you ready or  not?,  though  there  is a possibility that  the expression of the alternative, which if not expressed would be im- plied, conveys a special emphasis. The third differs from the second (if gram- mar is put aside) only as a piece of ELEGANT  VARIATION  differs  from  the same  meaning given  without  the varia- tion  j  otherwise  is used to escape repeat- ing,  in  insolvency,  the previous  solvency. Few readers who will compare  without prejudice the  three  forms will refuse to admit  that  the best of the three, wher- ever it is possible, is the first and shortest— What  concerns  us is his sol- vency —,  the additions  or insolvency and  or  otherwise  being mere waste of words.

out of the frying-pan.,"A  very  large proportion  of  the mistakes  that  are made in writing result neither from simple ignorance nor from careless- ness,  but from the  attempt  to avoid what are rightly or wrongly taken to be faults of grammar or style. The writer who produces an ungrammati- cal,  an  ugly,  or even a noticeably awkward phrase, and lets us see  that he has done it in trying to get rid of something else  that  he was afraid of, gives  a worse impression of himself than if he had risked our  catching  him in  his original misdemeanour  ;  he is out of  the frying-pan into the fire. A few typical examples will be here collected, with  references to other articles in which the tendency to mistaken cor- rection is set forth more at  large. Recognition  is given to it by no matter whom  it is displayed.  The frying-pan was  'no  matter  whom it is displayed by',  which the writer did not dare keep,  with  its preposition at end; but in  his hurry he jumped into nonsense; see MATTER, and PREPOSITION AT END. / When the  record  of this  campaign  comes dispassionately  to be written, and  in  just perspective,  it will  be  found  that ...

On the details of that picture we  need not dwell; but the moral which Mr.  Begbie  appears to draw from his contrast  is that a Conservative Irish Parliament  will do little to better the conditions  of town life, and that the industrial  classes  would find  relief  from those  conditions  more  quickly wider the ride  of the English Parliament, which, pace  Mr.  Begbie,  is advancing rapidly towards  some  form of Socialism.  /  For more  than ten thousand years these things  have been  recognized  in some part  of the world; during that lapse of time, at least,  some  men and  women  have been  living  according  to their own lights rather  than  according  to the light of nature.

"package,","long established as a noun, has  been given fresh duties  both  as a  verb and as an adjective. The appear- ance of a new verb, to  package,  when we already have to  pack,  puts  on those who use it the onus of showing  that  it is not  merely  a  LONG  VARIANT.  They have a good case : to  package  means— or should  mean—something  more than to  pack.  Anyone can pack by cramming things anyhow into a suitcase ; to pack- age  is to fit things neatly and securely into parcels  ;  it is a skill  that  has to be taught. Moreover,  packaging  is the name suitably given to a busy and growing  industry engaged in devising and manufacturing new types of wrap- pers and containers. As an adjective, package  is used attributively of terms of  agreement offered by one negotiat- ing  party to another, or of the deal  that results, meaning  that  what  is offered all  hangs together; it may be accepted or rejected as a whole, but the package must  not be undone and some of its contents taken and others left.  Has the untying of the Western package plan for  German  reunification  and  European security  already begun, and will a sepa- rate  agreement  on Berlin now be  discus- sed?  In this sense it can claim to be a  useful  metaphor,  saying in one word what  would otherwise need several.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

But when we drop the  pair(s) of,  as we usually do, and just say scissors  etc., we may mean either one pair or more than one; and even when we mean only one we always  treat  the word as grammatically plural. It fol- lows  that,  although its use for more than one pair may be unambiguous (There  are plenty of  scissors  in the house),  its use for a single pair (  These scissors  need sharpening)  must  always be grammatically ambiguous, how- ever clear the intention may be.

 and snares.,"Of the  large  num- ber  of  words  that  are  sometimes  con- fused  with  others  a  small selection  is here given.  It  will  be  noticed  that nearly  all  are of  Latin origin;  the con- fusion  arises  largely  from  the  English- man's natural failure,  if he has not learnt Latin,  to  realize instinctively  the force  of  suffixes  that  are not  native. Those  who  have  any  doubts  of  their infallibility  may find  it  worth  while  to go  through  the  list  and  make sure  that these pairs have  no  terrors  for  them; under  one or  other  of  most  of the pairs  in its  dictionary place they will find remarks  upon  the  difference,  and usually  proofs  that  the  confusion does occur. While  the  Englishman's vague- ness  about Latin suffixes  or  préfixes  is the most frequent cause  of  mistakes,  it is  not the  only  one.  Often  the two words might legitimately have been equivalents,  or  actually were  in  older usage,  and the  ignorance  is not of Latin  elements  but of  English idiom and  the  changes  that  DIFFERENTIATION has  brought about.  And  again  there are pairs  in  which  the  connexion  be- tween  the two  words  is  only  a  seeming one.  To  exemplify  briefly,  contemp- tuous  and  contemptible  are a  pair  in which suffixes  may  well  be  confused; masterful  and  masterly  one in  which differentiation may well be overlooked  ; and  deprecate  and  depreciate  one of the wholly false pairs. The list  is as  follows: acceptance and acceptation; advance and advance- ment;  affect  and  effect; alternate  and alternative; antitype  and  prototype; apologue and apology; ascendancy  and 433",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 pants.,"The words we use  for  what were once called generi- cally  nether garments  have undergone some curious variations, partly  due to changes  of  fashion  in the way we  like to cover  or  expose  our  legs,  and  partly under  the  influence  of  EUPHEMISM, which demands constant change  in the names  we  give  to  anything supposed to have indelicate associations,  in  this case  even going  so far at one  time  as to  throw  the  cloak  of  unmentionables  or inexpressibles  over  the  whole shocking business.

C.j  until the early twenties  were  well begun,  and Mr. B. finds little  fresh  to say about the early  period — the  narra- tive  is  full of  interest  and  documentation. 2.  Relevance. A parenthesis may or may  not have a grammatical relation to the sentence in which it is inserted. In  This  is, as far as I know, the whole truth  there  is such a relation, and in This  is, I swear, the whole truth  there is  not;  but one is as legitimate as the other. It is not equally immaterial whether the parenthesis is relevant or not to its sentence;  parentheses  like the following cannot possibly be justi- fied  :  In writing this  straightforward  and workmanlike  biography  of his  grand- father  {the  book  was finished  before  the war, and delayed in publication) Mr. Walter  Jerrold  has aimed at doing justice  to  Douglas  Jerrold  as dramatist, as  social  reformer  and as  good-natured man.  The time of writing and the delay in  publication have no conceivable bearing  on the straightforwardness, workmanlikeness,  biographicality, grandfatherliness,  justice, drama, re- form, or good nature,  with  which the sentence is concerned. If it had been called  a long-expected instead of a straightforward biography, it would have been quite another  matter;  but, as  it is, the parenthesis is as disconcert- ing  as a pebble  that  jars one's  teeth  in a mouthful of plum pudding. The very worst way of introducing an additional fact is to  thrust  it as a parenthesis into the middle of a sentence  with  which it has nothing to do. A similar example is:  Napoleon's  conversations  with Ber- trand  and Moncholon (it is unfortunate that  there  are  several  misprints in the book)  are a skilful blending of  record and pastiche. 3.  Identification. Still more fatal than readiness to resort to parenthesis where it is irrelevant is inability to tell a parenthesis from a main sen- tence.  A remarkable change had  come over  the Government,  he suggested, since  the Bill had left the Committee, and  expressed doubts  as to  whether  the Minister  altogether  approved  of the new turn of affairs.  In this,  he  suggested  is as  much a parenthesis as if it had been enclosed  in brackets; if it were not parenthetic, the sentence would run He  suggested  that a change had  come. But  the writer, not knowing a paren- thesis  when he sees one (or even when he  makes one), has treated it as parallel with  expressed,  and so fully parallel that  its  he  may be expected to do duty with  expressed  as well as  with  suggested. Either the first  part  should be re- written  as above  with  suggested  for its governing  verb, or another  he  must be inserted before  expressed. 4.

Parthian shot  refers to the tactics of the Parthian  mounted archers,  who would discharge a volley into the enemy while moving smartly out of range of  retaliation  ;  parting shot is  ordinarily used to describe a 'last word' fired by one of the parties to an argument at the  other  before breaking off  the verbal engagement. Although the Parthian tactics were undoubtedly formidable,  it is a  MISAPPREHENSION  to use  Parthian shot  to mean merely an attack  that  strikes home; the essence of  it is  that  the attack is made at the moment  of  retreat.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
partially,"is often used where  partly would be  better.  This is, no  doubt, because it is formed normally, by way of  the adjective  partial,  while  partly formed direct from the noun  part  is abnormal. There is  much  the same difference  between  the two words as between  wholly  (opp.  partly)  and  com- pletely  (opp.  partially) ;  in  other  words, partly  is  better  in the sense 'as regards a  part  and not the whole', and  partially in the sense 'to a limited degree' :  It is partly wood;  This  was partly due to cowardice;  A partially drunken sailor; His partially   re-established  health.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

For this danger, as insidious  as notorious, see  UNATTACHED PARTICIPLE. 2.  Absolute construction.  The Muni- cipal  Council, having  refused  their assistant  clerks'  demand  for a  rise  in salary,  those  in the  Food  Supply  offices today declared a strike.  This false stopping  (there  should be no comma after  Council)  is an example of  what  is perhaps  both  the worst and the com- monest of all mistakes in punctuation. See  ABSOLUTE CONSTRUCTION. 3.  Fused p. The construction so called  is fully discussed in the article FUSED  PARTICIPLE. 4.  Sentry  participle  etc. If news- paper editors, in the interest of their readers,  maintain any discipline over the gentlemen who provide inch-long paragraphs,  they should take measures against  a particular form  that,  by a survival  of the  unfittest,  bids fair to swallow  up all others. In these para- graphs,  before we are allowed to enter, we are challenged by the sentry in the guise  of a participle or some equivalent posted  in advance to secure  that  our interview  with  the  CO.  (or subjectof the sentence) shall not  take  place without  due ceremony  .The  fussiness  of this is probably entertaining while it is quite fresh ; one cannot tell, because it is  no longer fresh to anyone. It is likely to result in jamming together two un- related ideas in one sentence. Exam- ples :  Described  as  'disciples  of Tolstoi', two  Frenchmen  sentenced  at Cheltenham to  two months'  imprisonment  for false statements  to the  registration  officer  are not  to be  recommended  for  deportation,  j Winner of many  rowing  trophies,  Mr. Robert  George  Dugdale,  aged  seventy- five,  died  at  Eton.  /  Believed to be the youngest  organist  in the country, Master Herbert  Woolverton, who officiates at Hutton Church, Essex, has  passed  the examination  as  Associate  of.../  Thirty- four  years in the choir of the Chapel Royal,  Hampton Court Palace, Mr. Francis  P. Hill, of Milner  Road,  Kings- ton,  has  retired.  /  Found  standing  in  play astride  the live rail of the  electric  line at Willesden  and in  danger  of  instant  death, Walter Spentaford, twelve, was fined 12s.  for  trespass.  The device of the sentry participle is now worked so hard that  the participle is liable to become UNATTACHED,  though it cannot often be left in the air quite so egregiously as  are the two participles in this description of the departure of  Grivas from Cyprus.  Seen off at Nicosia air- port  by the head of the security  forces which  had  failed to track him, boastfully claiming  that he had spent his time  'with the  British', seldom has an Imperial Power  looked  so ridiculous. 5.  Accent and pronunciation in p.p. (or participial adjective or nouns) and verb.  Beside many of the verbs formed from Latin supine stems  (animate, dilute, extract,  etc.)  there  are passive participles of the same spelling, now used as adjectives or nouns. They are often distinguished from the verbs by a  difference  in sound. This may be (A) a shifting of the accent, as in attri'bute  v.,  a'ttribute  n.  ;  co'nsummate v.,  consummate  a.  ;  convi'ct  v.,  co'nvict n.;  dicta'te  v.,  di'ctates  n.j  dige'st  v., di'gest  n.  ;  extra'ct  v.,  e'xtract n. ;  refu'se v.,  re'fuse  n.; (B) the obscuring of the vowel  of-ate  into an indeterminate light  sound, as  modérât  v. becomes moderet  a., and the same phenomenon can  be seen in  advocate, animate, articulate,  degenerate,  delegate, de- liberate,  designate, desolate, elaborate, estimate,  legitimate,  regenerate,  repro- bate,  separate, subordinate.

The impulse  is  healthy  for  children,  and nearly  universal—which  is  just  why warning  is  necessary;  for  among  so many  there  will always  be  some  who fail  to  realize  that  the  clever habit applauded  at  home will make  them insufferable abroad. Most  of  those who are capable  of  writing well enough to find readers  do  learn sooner  or later  that  playful  use of  long  or learned words  is a  one-sided game boring  the  reader more than  it  pleases the  writer,  that  the  impulse  to it is",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 purism.,"Pedantry may  be  defined,  for the  purpose  of this book,  as the  saying  of  things  in language  so  learned  or so  demonstra- tively  accurate as  to  imply  a  slur upon the generality, who are  not  capable  or not desirous  of  such displays.  The term, then, is obviously a relative one; my pedantry  is  your scholarship,  his reasonable  accuracy,  her  irreducible minimum  of  education,  and  someone else's  ignorance.  It is  therefore  not very  profitable  to  dogmatize here  on the  subject;  an  essay  would establish not what p. is,  but  only the place  in  the scale  occupied  by the  author. There are  certainly many accuracies  that  are not pedantries,  as  well  as  some  that are;  there  are  certainly some pedan- tries  that  are  not  accuracies, as well as many  that  are;  and no  book  that attempts,  as  this  one  does,  to  give hundreds  of  decisions  on the  matter will  find many readers who will accept them  all. Purism  is  like pedantry, except  that it does  not  necessarily imply  a  parade of  superior learning.  Now and  then a  person may  be  heard  to  'confess',  in the pride  that  apes humility,  to  being 'a  bit  of a purist' ; but  purist  and  purism are  for the  most part missile words, which we all  of  us  fling  at  anyone who insults  us by  finding  not  good enough for  him  some manner  of  speech  that is  good enough for us.  It  is  in  that  dis- paraging  sense  that  the words are used in  this  book; by  purism  is to be  under- stood  a  needless  and  irritating  insis- tence  on  purity  or  correctness  of speech. Pure  English,  however, even 442",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
pediment,"apart from  the  great  number  of elements (vocabulary, grammar, idiom, pronunciation, and so forth)  that  go  to make  it up, is so  relative  a  term  that almost every  man is  potentially  a purist and  a  sloven  at  once  to  persons looking  at him  from  a  lower  and a higher  position  in the  scale than  his own.  The  words have therefore  not been very freely used;  that  they should be renounced altogether would  be too much  to  expect, considering  the  sub- ject  of  the book. It follows  that  readers  who  find  a usage  stigmatized  as  pedantry  or purism have  a  right  to  know  the  stig- matizer's place  in the  scale,  if  his stigma  is not to be  valueless. Accord- ingly,  under headings  of  various mat- ters  in  which these propensities may colour judgement,  a few  articles  are now mentioned  by  referring  to  which the reader who has views  of  his own will  be  able  to  place  the  book  in the scale,  and judge what may be expected of  it.

per.,"It is  affected  to  use Latin when English  will serve  as  well;  so  much  a year  is  better  than  per annum  and much better  than  per year,  and  there  is no point  in  saying  per  passenger train when  we can say  by.  But  when  a preposition  is  needed,  and no  English one is  available,  per  may be  useful  even with  an  English  noun.  Output  a  man- shift  a day  is an  awkward  way of expressing  a  formula which  is  clear  if per  is  used. Generally, however,  it is best  to  confine  per  to its  own language in  established phrases such as  per cent., PER  CAPITA,  per  contra,  and  per  stirpes.

This use  is a  modern  blunder, encouraged in  some recent dictionaries. '(So much) a  head',  or  'per  man',  which  is the meaning here, would  not  be  per capita (any  more than  it  would  be  'per men'), but  per caput  if  Latin had  to be  used. Per  capita  describes  the  method  of sharing  property  in  which persons, and  not  families,  are  the  units, and  its opposite  is  per  stirpes  (Patrimonial estates  are divided  per  capita;  purchased estates,  per  stirpes)  ; it is out of  place, and something  of a  barbarism,  how- ever lately popular,  except  in  such  a context.

After past tenses  of  hope,  fear, expect,  and the  like,  the  perfect infini- tive  is  used, incorrectly perhaps,  but so  often  and  with  so  useful  an im- plication  that  it  has become idiomatic.

Sometimes  a  writer,  dimly aware  that  'would  have liked  to  have done'  is  usually wrong,  is yet so  fasci- nated  by the  perfect infinitive  that  he clings  to  that  at all  costs,  and  alters instead  the  part  of his  sentence  that was  right:  On the point  of  church  James was obdurate;  he  would like  to  have insisted  on the  other  grudging  items (would have liked  to  insist). 3.  With  seem,  appear,  and the  like, people  get  puzzled over  the  combina- tions  of the  present  and  past  of  seem etc.  with  the  present and perfect  of  the infinitive.  The  possible combinations are:  He  seems  to  know,  He  seems  to have known,  He  seemed  to  know,  He seemed  to  have known.

personality.,"Both words  are  used  for  exceptional kinds of  persons,  but  with  a  difference.

 metonymy.,"When  a country is spoken of as  She,  we have personifica- tion  ;  when  we  doubt  whether  to  write The  Board   refuse  or   The  Board refuses,  we are pulled up by a noun of multitude  ;  when  we call  Queen  Eliza- beth  the Crown,  we use metonymy. Some mistakes incident to these forms of  speech run into one another, and are therefore grouped together here, under the headings:  1.  Ill-advised personification. 2. Vacillation. 3. Un- attached possessives. 1.   Ill-advised personification. To figure 'the world' as a female, a certain 'quarter'  or certain  'circles'  as sentient, or 'Irish womanhood' as a woman, is to be  frigid—the  epithet  proper  to those who make futile  attempts  at decoration. Such personifications are implied in  Just now  the world  wants all that America can give  her  in ship- ping  (read  it  for  her),  in  But on applica- tion to  the quarter most likely to know /  was assured that the paper in question was not written by Dickens  (The quarter is  no  doubt  a person or persons, and capable of knowledge; but it will surely  never do to let  that  secret out), in  According to  Foreign  Offices  circles reports  on him by the British Embassy in Moscow  were  ignored  by the Admiralty (Perhaps the  writer  thought  that 'circles'  had a more intimate air  than the usual 'spokesman', who can only hand out  what  he has been given, cf. SOURCE),  and in  The  womanhood of Ireland  stands for individualism as against  co-operation,  and presents the practical  domestic arguments in  her support  (Whether  her  implies the personification of  womanhood  or of individualism  does not  much  matter;  it must  be one or the  other,  and neither is  suited for the treatment). It is in places like these, where a  writer hardly intends personification,  but slips  unconsciously or half-heartedly into implying it,  that  he reveals his",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
personification,"want  of literary instinct. On the  other hand a personification may be a more convenient  object  of attack  than persons; it cannot answer back:  He accused  imperialism and  colonialism  of being  behind the plot to murder him. 2.  Vacillation.  Britain, Paris,  and the like,  are words naturally admitting of personification, and can be referred to in  their  literal sense by  it  and  its,  or in their  personified sense by  she  and  her. So  much  everyone knows;  what  will perhaps surprise the reader is to find how many writers are capable of ab- surdly mixing the two methods in a single  phrase. In the following ex- amples the words in which the vacilla- tion is exhibited are in roman type: Germany deserted and rearmed. So did Japan,  which  defied efforts to stop  her invading Manchuria.  /  When  Poplar no longer  maintains  its  own paupers  she must no  longer  determine  the standard  on which they are to be maintained.  /  The United  States has given  another  proof of its  determination to uphold  her  neutral- ity.  For  other  examples see  WHICH, THAT, WHO  8, and for similar vacilla- tion  between  singular and plural verbs with  nouns of  multitude  see  NUMBER  6. 3.  Unattached possessives.  Danish sympathy with Finland is writ  large  over all  her  newspapers,  literature, and  public speeches,  as the most casual visitor to Copenhagen  can  see.  Her  means 'of (the personified)  Denmark'  ; we can all see that;  but we most of us also resent, nevertheless, a personification  that  is done not on the stage, but  'off'  ; a Den- mark personified and not presented is a  sort of shadow of a shade. /  This  is a timely tribute from a  man  who has spent  a  large  part of his life in Friendly Society  work, and who would be the last to  sanction anything that imperilled their  interests.

A  name given  by Henry Bradley  to  those fixed combina- tions  of  verb  and  adverbial particle from which  (to  quote Pearsall Smith) 'we derive thousands  of  vivid collo- quialisms  and  idiomatic phrases  by means  of  which  we  describe  the  great- est variety  of  human actions  and relations'—the  combinations  for in- stance  of  verbs such  as  get, put,  take, set,  with  adverbs such  as  in,  out, to, from,  up,  down,  to  give differences  of meaning which  in  languages  of a  more synthetic structure  are  represented  by compound verbs.  The use of  phrasal verbs  as  nouns,  a  prominent feature of  contemporary English  (e.g.  set-to, take-over,  hold-up, show-down,  wash- out),  has  also  proved  an  invaluable method  of  enriching  our  vocabulary vigorously  from native material instead of  relying  on  foreign borrowing. This useful resource  is now  being abused. Owing perhaps  to a  craving for  prolixity  we  have  got  into  the habit  of  using phrasal verbs  in  senses no different from  that  of the  parent verb alone, though some  of  them,  when coined,  may  have been intended  to",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

phrasal verbs,"have  a  different nuance. This  pre- ference  is  largely  of  U.S. origin,  but we have  proved  ready pupils.  It  may  be that  new combinations  are  invented,  as meet  up  with  is  used  for  meet, visit with for  visit,  lose  out on  for  lose,  match  up for  match, miss  out on  for  miss,  man up for  man,  and  win out  for  win.  Or it  may be  that  an  established combination  is used  not in its  proper sense  but as a synonym  of the  simple verb.  The differences  in  meaning between  check and  check  up on,  close  and  close  down, face  and  face  up to,  start  and  start  up, stop  and  stop  off, try  and  try out, though real,  are  subtle—in  some  the particle  is  merely  an  intensification— and  it is  perhaps natural, however regrettable,  that  they should  be  disap- pearing owing  to  this curious dislike  of the verb standing alone.  A  less  ex- cusable example  of the  ousting  of a simple verb  by a  phrasal  one is  that  of pay,  in the  sense  of  prove profitable, by  pay off,  which already  had its special  and  very different meanings  of finally  discharging  an  obligation  or a crew  and of  letting  a  sailing-boat  fall away  from  the  wind. This novel  use of pay  off  has  become  so  common  that pay  as an  intransitive verb seems likely  to  disappear.  Nothing paid  off more  quickly  on the  railways than  the substitution  of  diesel  locomotives  for steam.  /  His  view that  if Mr.  Cousins wanted  to get  tough  he  could  not  carry the  bulk  of the  trade-union  leaders  with him  has  paid  off  fairly well.  /  He recognizes  that  Pope's  conscious  artistry, his endless patient polishing,  his  wish always  to  write  at his  best, pays  off.  / The  Prime  Minister's  remaking  of his Cabinet has paid  off  handsomely.

pleonasm,"is the using of more words than are required to give the sense intended (see  also  TAUTOLOGY). 1.  It is often resorted to deliberately for  rhetorical effect  (Lest at any time they should  see  with  their eyes  and hear with  their  ears).  The writer who uses p. in  that  way must be judged by whether  he does produce his effect and whether  the occasion is worthy of it. 2.  There are many phrases originally put together for the sake of such  em- phasis,  but repeated  with  less  and  less effect until they end by boring instead of  impressing the hearer. Such are the pairs of synonyms  if and when, unless  and until, save and except, in any shape  or  form,  of any  sort  or  kind.  These and many others have long worn out their force, and  what  those who would write  vigorously have to do  with  them is  merely to unlearn  them;  see IF  AND WHEN,  the apparently least pleonastic of  these stock phrases, for  fuller  dis- cussion.

1.,"See  -ics  2 for the question whether words in  -ics  are singular  or plural. 2.  Plurals of words  ending-5.  Names of  diseases,  such as  mumps, measles, glanders,  can be treated as singular or  plural;  chickenpox  and  smallpox, originally  plural, are now reckoned singular.  Innings,  corps,  and some other words in  -s,  are singular or plural  without  change of spelling, but, while  corps  has  -s  silent in singular and sounded in plural,  an innings  and several  innings  show no distinction, whence arises the colloquial double plural  inningses.  For proper names ending  -s  the correct plural form is -es — t)ie  Joneses,  the  Rogerses,  etc. Cf. FORCEPS  and GALLOWS. The  growing tendency to indicate the plural of proper names, especially if of more than one syllable, by writing  the Rogers',  the  Evans'  is an abuse of the apostrophe on which see  POSSESSIVE PUZZLES  7. 3.  Plurals of compound words. These ordinarily  form their plurals  logically, by  attaching the  -s  to the noun element in  them,  or, if  there  is more than one noun, to the significant one.  Listeners- in, sons-in-law, heirs presumptive, master  mariners,  tugs of war,  deeds  poll. But  many  familiar compounds now make their plurals as if they were single  words  (char-a-bancs,  will-o'-the- wisps,  four-in-hands),  especially if they contain no noun  (ne'er-do-wells,  for- get-me-nots),  or are  -ful  compounds (handfuls, mouthfuls,  spoonfuls),  or are PHRASAL VERBS  used as nouns  (take-offs, knock-outs,  call-ups).  Compounds con- taining  man  or  woman  make  both elements plural  (menservants, women clerks),  and so usually, though not always,  do two words linked by  and (ins-and-outs,  pros  and  cons,  rights-and- lefts,  ups-and-downs).  Our compounded drinks  we  usually  think of as a  single entity, and are likely to ask for two whisky-and-sodas,  two  gin-and-tonics, etc. ; if we make an exception in asking for  two  gins-and-French,  it will only be because of the awkwardness of Frenches. Lord  Chancellors,  Lord  Mayors,  and Lord  Provosts,  being special kinds of chancellors,  mayors, and provosts, logically  put the  s  on the second word as  the significant one; and for the same  reason  Lords of Appeal, Lords of",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 anomalies,"Session,  Lords in  Waiting,  etc., being special  kinds of lords, put it on the first.  But   the  Lords Commissioners of  the Treasury  and the  Lords  Justices of  the  Court  of Appeal traditionally add the  s  to  both  words. For  Lord Lieutenant  the official plural is  Lords Lieutenant,  but the OED  gives  as alternatives  both  Lords Lieutenants and  Lord   Lieutenants.  Lieutenant General  and  Major General,  being now regarded as special kinds of general,  and  not,  as they once were, special  kinds of lieutenant and major, logically  have the  s  at the end, and Adjutant  Generals  and  Quartermaster Generals  have  followed  suit by  analogy. The officials called  General  in civil life,  e.g.  Attorney G.,  Solicitor  G., Governor  G.,  Postmaster G.,  Pay- master  G.,  being special kinds of attorney, solicitor, etc., should be Attorneys General and so on. But Attorney Generals and Solicitor Gen- erals  are now the usual plurals for those officers (said by the OED to be 'better') ; and, although  Whitaker's Almanack  still  gives  Governors  General and the OED would have us say  Post- masters  General,  titles such as these, so far  as they have need of a plural, will no  doubt  eventually  fall  into line, following  the popular tendency to dis- regard  these niceties  that  has already made  court  martials  and  poet  laureates sound at least as natural to us as the more correct  courts  martial  and  poets laureate. 4.  Plurals of words ending  -y.  There are few exceptions to the rule  that, when the  y  is preceded  by  a vowel, the plural is formed by adding  -s  in the ordinary way, and when it is preceded by a consonant the plural is  -ies {days, donkeys,  spies,  jetties).  Soliloquies  is not a  true  exception, for  qu  in English is in effect a  single  consonant;  monies  as an  alternative plural to  moneys  is obso- lescent, and so is the vehicle  that  used to make its plural  flys  to distinguish them  from insects.

With  three-cornered con- tests as common as they now are, we may  have occasion to find a convenient single  word  for  what  we used to call an  absolute majority,  but now, under the baneful influence of  OVERALL,  have rechristened an  overall majority,  i.e. a majority comprising more than half the  votes  cast. In America the word majority  itself has  that  meaning, while a  poll greater than  that  of any other candidate, but  less  than half the votes cast,  is called a  plurality.  It might be useful to borrow this distinction, but to  better  it by changing  plurality  to plurity.  The correct meaning  of  plural- ity  is not moreness (which is the notion wanted, but which would be  plurity), but pluralness or  seyeralness  or  more- than-oneness.  Plurity  is an obsolete English  word exactly suited to the need;  cf.  REVIVALS.  See  also  MAJORITY. pn-.

There is no valid objection to  standpoint  but  p. 0. v. holds  its own where the  of  difficulty does  not present itself.  Viewpoint,  an earlier  product  of the repugnance to standpoint,  has the disadvantage of calling  to mind what  standpoint  allows to be forgotten,  that  the idiomatic English  is  undoubtedly  p. of  view.

Freud and his successors  have  awakened in us a similar  interest in our minds, and the cult of psychoanalysis, especially in America, has produced a new jargon, sometimes called  Freudian  English, that  employs  with  greater freedom than accuracy  terms such as  ambivalent, antitype,  complex,  ego,  egocentric,  euph- oric,  extrovert, father  figure,  fixation, id,  imbalance,inhibition,  introvert,libido, manic, masochistic,  moron,  narcissism, persona,  phobia, psyche, psychopath (abbreviated to  psycho,  and replacing the  old  mental),  repression,  schizophrenic (abbreviated to  schizo.),  subconscious, and  trauma.  Gossip columnists  report this jargon as current in  what  might be thought improbable places.  Mrs. R., wife  of a Texas businessman, a  tall handsome  woman,  refused  a glass of champagne.

There  are certain verb groups  about which the question is  conceivable— Should they be allowed to be inter- rupted  by adverbs? Such are the in- finitive,  e.g.  to try  (may we say  to earnestly  try}),  the compound verb, e.g.  have thought  (may we say /  have never  thought  so?),  the copula and complement,  e.g.  was a riddle  (may we say  He  zvas  in  some  ways a riddle}),",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 the,"verb and its object, e.g.  passed the time (may we say  It passed pleasantly the time}),  the gerund and its governing preposition, e.g.  by  going  (may we say by often  going}).  The first of these questions is a very familiar one; almost all  who aspire to  write  English have had the split infinitive forced on  their attention,  and the avoidance of it has become a fetish. The  other  questions are not familiar, but the points here to  be  made are  that  they  also require consideration,  that  a universal yes or a  universal no is not the right answer either to the split-infinitive question or to any of the others,  that  the various answers sometimes come into conflict, and  that  to concentrate on the split- infinitive question and let the others take care of themselves is absurd. The misplacements to be considered will be taken under the heads :  1.  Split infinitive. 2. Fear of split infinitive. 3.  Imaginary split infinitive passive. 4.  Splitting of the compound verb. 5.  Separation of copulative verb and complement. 6. Separation of transi- tive  verb  and object. 7. Separation of preposition and gerund. 8. Heedless misplacings. 1.  Split infinitive. The heinousness of  this offence is estimated in the article  SPLIT  INFINITIVE.  Here   the general  result of  that  estimate is merely assumed, viz.: (A)  that  to love  is a definitely enough recognized verb- form to make the clinging together of its parts the natural and normal thing, (B)  that  there  is, however, no sacro- sanctity  about  that  arrangement, (C) that  adverbs should be  kept  outside if there  is neither anything gained by putting  them  inside nor any  difficulty in finding  them  another place, but (D)  that  such gain or difficulty will often justify the confessedly abnormal splitting. One pair of examples will throw  light on C and D :  The  people are  now returning and trying  to again get together  a  home,  j  With  us outside the Treaty, we must expect the Com- mission  to at least neglect  our interests. In the first, it is easy to  write  to get a home  together  again,  and, as  again  does not belong to the single word  get,  but to  get a  home  together,  nothing is gained by its abnormal placing. In the second, at least  cannot be put before  to  because it would  then  go  with  Commission (i.e. the Commission, even if not  other people), nor after  neglect  because it would  then  be  doubtful  whether  it referred back to  neglect  or forward to interests,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 nor,"after  interests  because it would  then  belong either to  interests or to  neglect  our interests,  neither of which is  what  is meant; where it stands,  it secures our realizing  that  the writer  has in mind some  other  verb such as  injure  or  oppose  with  which the weaker  neglect  is to be contrasted. In a split infinitive, however, we have not  so  much  a misplacing of the adverb as  a violence done to the verb. It is by repulsion,  not by attraction,  that  the infinitive acts in effecting the many misplacings,  to be shown below, for which it is responsible. 2.  Fear of split infinitive. The order of  words in the following examples is bizarre enough to offend the least cultivated ear; the reason why the writers, whose ears were perhaps no worse  than  their  neighbours', were not struck by it is  that  they were obsessed by fear of infinitive-splitting. It will",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
position of adverbs,"be seen  that  the natural (not necessarily the best) place for the adverb in each is  where it would split an  infinitive. Such  gentlemen are  powerless  to analyse correctly  agricultural  conditions,  j A body of Unionist employers which still has power to influence  greatly  opinion among  those who  work  for them.  /  Might I  kindly  ask  you to forward?  The place into which each adverb has been shifted is such  that  one or  other  of the faults explained in later sections is committed,  and the  writer  is OUT OF THE  FRYING-PAN  into the fire; see especially  6. But the  terrorism  exercised by the split infinitive is most conspicuous where  there  is in fact (see  next  section) no danger. 3.  Imaginary split infinitive passive. In the following examples it is again clear  that  the natural place for the adverb is not where it now stands, but invariably  after the words  to be.  To insert an  adverb  between  to  and  be would be splitting an infinitive; to insert one  between  to be  and  concerned, pained,  etc.,  is nothing of the kind, but is  a particular case of the construaion explained in 5. The position after  to be is  not only the natural one in these sentences, but the best. The  mistake— and  that  it is a definite mistake  there  is no  doubt  whatever—is  illustrated  in the following extracts:  Every citizen worth  the name ought  vitally  to be con- cerned  in today's  election.  /  All of us who believe  in parliamentary institutions cannot  fail  deeply  to be pained at read- ing  the story.  /  The nuisance of  allowing visitors  to  cross  the footlights had begun so  much  to be felt by the London theatrical  managers that they  . . . /  We think the public will not fail  unfavour- ably  to be  impressed  by the shifting nature  of the arguments.  /  An Act has been  passed  enabling agricultural land compulsorily  to be acquired at a fair market  price,  j At a time when NA TO needs  drastically  to be  reformed  in its structure  arid  purpose. 4.  Splitting of the compound verb. By  compound  verb  is meant a verb made up of an auxiliary (or more  than one) and an infinitive  (without  to)  or",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
464,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
position of adverbs,"participle.  When  an adverb is to be used  with  such a verb, its normal place is  between  the auxiliary (or sometimes the first auxiliary if  there  are two or more) and the rest. Not only is  there no objection to  thus  splitting  a  com- pound  verb, but any  other  position for the adverb requires special justifica- tion : /  have never seen her,  not  /  never have seen her,  is the ordinary idiom, though  the  rejected order becomes the right one if emphasis is to be put on have  (/  may have had  chances  of  seeing her  but  I  never  have).  But  it  is plain from the string of examples now to come that  a prejudice has grown up against dividing  compound verbs. It is prob- ably  a supposed corollary of the ac- cepted  split-infinitive prohibition; at any  rate, it is entirely unfounded. In each of the first four extracts  there  is one auxiliary; and after  that,  instead of  before it, the adverb should have been put; the  other  four have two auxiliaries  each (which raises a  further question to be  touched  upon  in the following paragraph): Single auxi- liary:  If his  counsel  still is followed,  'the conflict'  is indeed inevitable.  /  Its very brief  span  of  insect-eating  activity  hardly can  redeem its  general  evil habit as a grain-devourer.  j Politicians of all  sorts in the United States  already are  girding up their  loins  for the next  election.  /  Yet one  of the latest Customs rulings by the United States  Board  of Appraisers assuredly,  to use the phrase its  members best would  understand, is  l the  limit'.  / Double auxiliary :  Oxford  must  heartily be  congratulated on their victory.  /  If the desired end is ever attained it  earn- estly  may be  hoped  that especial  care will be taken with the translation.  /  The importance  which  quite  rightly has been given  to  reports  of their  meetings,  j  The Maharaja made  arrangements  for her education,  which  never since has been permitted  to languish.  Write  must be heartily  congratulated,  it may  be  earnest- ly hoped, which has quite rightly been given,  which has never since been per- mitted. This minor  point  of  whether  the adverb is to follow the first auxiliary or the whole auxiliary depends on",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
position of adverbs,"the answer to  a  not very simple riddle—Is  it in intimate connexion with  the verbal notion itself inde- pendently of the temporal or other limitations imposed by the auxiliaries ? Fortunately  this riddle can be trans- lated into simpler  terms—Do  the ad- verb and verb naturally suggest an adjective and noun? If so, let  them stand  next  each  other,  and if not, not. Heartily  congratulated,  earnestly  hoped, suggest  hearty congratulations and earnest hope; but  rightly given  does not suggest right gift or right  giving, and still  less  does  never  since  permitted suggest  no subsequent permission. That  means  that  the notions of  giving and permitting are qualified by  rightly and  never since  not absolutely, but under the particular limitations of the auxiliaries,  and  that  the adverb is better  placed between the auxiliaries than  next  to  given  and  permitted.  This, however, is a minor  point,  as was said above;  the main object of this section is  to stress the certain fact  that  there is  no objection whatever to dividing a  compound verb by adverbs. 5.  Separation of copulative verb and complement. This is on the same foot- ing  as the splitting of the compound verb discussed in 4;  that  is, it is a delusion to suppose  that  the insertion of  an adverb between the two parts is a  solecism, or even, like the splitting of  the infinitive, a practice to be re- garded  as abnormal. On the contrary, it is the natural arrangement, and in the following examples  fundamentally, also,  and  often,  have been mistakenly shifted from their right place owing to a  superstition:  It would be a different thing  if the  scheme  had  been  found  fun- damentally to be  faulty, but that is not the  case.  /  It is not  always  in these times that the  First  Lord  of the Treasury  also is  Prime  Minister.  /  The immense im- provement  which they have wrought in the  condition of the  people,  and which often is  quite  irrespective  of the number of  actual  converts. 6.

position of adverbs,"tive or inculcated, to keep the parts of a  verb group together and allow no adverb to intrude into it. But  there  is one kind of group  that  is only too often broken up by adverbs  that  ought to have been placed before or after the whole.  That  is the group consisting of a  transitive verb and its object. /  had to  second  by all the means in my  power diplomatic  action. To  second  diplomatic action  is the verb and object, separated by a  seven-word  adverb. It is a crying case;  everyone will agree to  deferring the adverb, and the writer had either no literary ear or some grammatical or stylistic  fad. The longer the adverb in proportion to the object, the more marked is the offence of interpolating it. But the same mistake is seen, though  less  glaringly,  in the following examples; the roman-type  adverb in each should be removed, some- times to a place before the verb, some- times to one after the object :  Are they quite  sure  that they have  interpreted rightly  the situation?  /  A lull of the breeze  kept  for a  time  the small boat in the  neighbourhood  of  the  brig.  /  He  spoke in a firm  voice,  marking  strongly  the syllables,  but in  tones  rather  harsh.  /  The only  conceivable  exception is  some  great question  affecting  vitally  human  liberty and human  conscience.  /  Continuation with the university  courses  would most certainly  elevate  further  the  people. There are conditions  that  justify the separation, the most obvious being when a lengthy object would keep an adverb  that  is not suitable for the early position too remote from the verb. One of  the extracts below may be adapted to illustrate; if it had run 'would ex- pose to ridicule an authority  that,  as it is, is not very imposing' instead of 'expose to the ridicule of all the restless elements in East Europe their author- ity which' etc., the shortness of 'to ridicule' compared  with  the length of  the object would have made  that order the best and almost necessary one. But anyone who applies this principle must be careful not to reckon as  part  of the object words  that  either do not belong to it at all or are unessen- tial to it; otherwise he will offend the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Meanings. Each word has senses in  which  there  is no fear  that  the other will be substituted for it; but in other senses  they come very near each other, and  confusion  is  both  natural and common. Safety lies in remembering that  practicable  means capable of being effected or accomplished,  and  practical means adapted to actual conditions. It is  true  that  the practicable  is  often practical, and  that  the practical is nearly  always practicable; but a very practical plan may prove impracti- cable  owing to change of circum- stances,  and a practicable policy may be thoroughly unpractical. In the ex- tracts  that  follow each word is used where the other was wanted:  In the case  of a club, if rules are  passed  ob- noxious  to a  large  section  of the  members, the  latter can  resign;  in our national relationships,  secession  is not  practical nowadays.  The last sentence is in clear antithesis to  the latter can  resign,  and means You cannot secede, or in other words Secession is not  practicable.  / But to plunge into the military question without  settling  the  Government  question would  not be  good  sense  or  practicable policy;  and  no wise  man  would expect to get  serviceable  recruits  in this way.  The policy  was certainly practicable, for it was  carried out; and the writer, though he had not the proof  that  we have of its practicability, probably did not mean to deny  that,  but only to say  that it was not suited to the conditions, i.e. practical. /  We live in a  low-pressure belt  where  cyclone  follows  cyclone;  but the  prediction of their arrival is at present  not  practical.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
practically.,"It is unfortunate  that practically  should have escaped from its  true  meaning into something like the opposite. It is  easy  to see how this came about. The word is reasonably used in such sentences as  It is  prac- tically worn out, He is practically insane,  meaning  that   the  thing, though it still works after a fashion, cannot be relied on as effective, or  that the person, though not certifiable, is as incompetent to deal  with  the practical affairs  of life as if he were. From this it is a short step to treating  practically as  synonymous  with  almost, and to absurdities such as  saying  of the losing horse in a photographic finish  that  it practically  won, which is exactly what it did not do. This straining  of  practi- cally  is the  less  excusable because more suitable adverbs are plentiful: e.g. almost,  nearly, ail-but, virtually, sub- stantially.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The Latinless have great difficulty  in realizing  that  the  words  are  not  inter- changeable variants.  P.  is  from Latin praedkare  to cry  forth  or  proclaim, but  predict  from Latin  praedïcere  to say  beforehand  or  foretell;  the  Latin simple verbs  are  different,  and  prae has  not the  same meaning  in the two compounds.  P.  makes  predicable  and predication,  predict  makes  predictable and  prediction.  It  is  naturally  predicate and  its  derivatives  that  are  misused; examples  of  the  misuse are :  The  case for  establishing compulsory  and  volun- tary systems side  by  side  in the  same country  is  not  only  not  proven,  but  involves a change  in  strategic theory that predi- cates  nothing  but  disaster  (threatens? foreshadows?  presages? just possibly predicts; certainly  not  predicates).  /  A profound  change  in the  balance  of  the Constitution predicable  by  anyone  who had  searched  the political  heavens  during the last four years  and  observed  the eccentric  behaviour  of  certain  bodies  and their satellites  is  now upon  us  (predict- able).  /  What  she would say  to  him, how he  would take  it,  even the vaguest predi- cation  of  their  discourse,  was  beyond him  to  guess  (anticipation? outline? prevision?  just possibly prediction; certainly  not  prédication).

It  is  easy sometimes  to  change  the  verb to  a  noun  (to die  to  death),  but by no means always.

'A sentence end- ing  in a preposition is an inelegant sentence' represents  what  used to be a  very general belief, and it is not yet dead. One of its chief supports is the fact  that  Dryden, an acknowledged master of English prose,  went  through all  his prefaces contriving away the final prepositions  that  he had been guilty  of in his first editions. It is interesting to find Ruskin almost reversing  this procedure. In the  text of  the  Seven Lamps  there  is a solitary final preposition to be found, and no more; but in the later footnotes they are not avoided  (Any  more  wasted words  . .. I never heard of.  /  Men whose occupation  for the next fifty years would be  the knocking down every beautiful building  they could lay their hands on). Dryden's earlier practice shows him following the English instinct; his later shows him sophisticated  with deliberate latinism: 'I am often put to a  stand in considering  whether  what  I write  be the idiom of the tongue, . . . and have no  other  way to clear my doubts but by translating my English into Latin'. The natural inference from this would be: you cannot put a  preposition (roughly speaking) later than its word in Latin, and therefore you  must  not do so in English.

 at end,"or the Like, even when they would have been adverbs. The  fact  is  that  the remarkable freedom enjoyed  by  English  in putting its pre- positions late and omitting its relatives is  an important element in the flexi- bility  of the  language.  The power of saying  A state of  dejection  such as they are  absolute  strangers  to  (Cowper) in- stead  of  A state of dejection of an intensity  to which they are  absolute strangers,  or  People  worth talking to instead  of  People  with whom it is worth while  to talk,  is not one to be lightly surrendered. But the Dryden-Gibbon tradition has remained in being, and even now immense pains are some- times  expended  in  changing spontaneous into artificial  English. That  depends  on what they are cut with is  not improved by conversion into That  depends  on with what they are cut', and  too often the lust of sophistication, once blooded, becomes uncontrollable, and  ends with,  That  depends on the answer  to the question as to with what they are cut.  Those who lay down the universal  principle  that  final preposi- tions are  'inelegant'  are unconsciously trying  to deprive the  English  language of  a valuable idiomatic resource, which has  been used freely by all our greatest writers except those whose instinct for English  idiom has been overpowered by  notions of correctness derived from Latin  standards. The legitimacy of the prepositional ending in literary English  must be uncompromisingly maintained; in respect of elegance or inelegance, every example must be judged  not by any arbitrary rule, but on its own merits, according to the impression  it makes on the feeling of educated  English  readers. In  avoiding the forbidden order, un- skilful  handlers of words often  fall  into real  blunders (see  OUT  OF  THE  FRYING- PAN).  A few examples of bad grammar obviously  due to this cause may  fairly be offered  without  any suggestion  that a  rule is responsible for all blunders made in attempting to keep it. The words in brackets indicate the avoided form, which is not necessarily the best, but is at least  better  than  that  substi- tuted  for it:  The War Office does not care,  the  Disposal  Board  is  indifferent, and  there  is no one  on whom  to fix the blame  or  to hang (no one to fix the blame on or to  hang).  /  The day  begins with a ride with the wife and as many others  as want to ride and  for whom there  is  horseflesh  available  (and as there are  horses for). /  This was a  memorable expedition  in every way, greatly  appre- ciated  by the  Japanese,  the Sinha- lese,  the Siamese, and with  whomever else  B.O.A.C.  briefly  deposited  their valuable  cargo  (and whomever else B.O.A.C.   briefly  deposited  their valuable  cargo with). /  It is like the art of  which  Huysmans  dreamed  but  never executed (the art  that  Huysmans dreamed of). /  That  promised  land  for which  he was to  prepare,  but  scarcely  to enter  (that  he was to prepare for). It was  said  above  that  almost all  our great  writers have allowed themselves to end a sentence or a clause  with  a preposition. A score or so of specimens follow  ranging over six centuries, to which may be added the  Bacon,  Cow- per, and Ruskin examples  already given:  (Chaucer) But yit to this thing ther  is yit another thing y-ijoigned, more to ben wondred upon. (Spenser) Yet childe ne kinsman living had he none To leave  them  to. (Shakespeare) Such  bitter  business as the day Would quake to look on. (Jonson) Preposi- tions follow  sometimes  the nouns they are  coupled with. (Bible) I will not leave  thee, until I have done  that  which I  have spoken to thee of. (Milton) What  a fine conformity would it starch us all into. (Burton) Fit for Calphur- nius  and Democritus to laugh at. (Pepys)  There is good ground for what he  goes  about.

prig,"is a word of variable and indefi- nite meaning; the following, from an anonymous volume of  essays,  may be useful : 'The best thing I can do, per- haps,  is to give you the various descrip- tions  that  would come into my head at different times if I were asked for one suddenly. A prig is a believer in red tape;  that  is, he exalts the method above the work done. A prig, like the Pharisee,  says  : ""God, I thank  thee  that I  am not as other men  are""—except that  he often substitutes  Self  for  God. A prig is one who works out his paltry accounts to the last farthing, while his millionaire  neighbour lets accounts take care of themselves. A prig expects others to square themselves to his very inadequate measuring-rod, and con- demns  them  with  confidence if they do not. A p. is wise beyond his years in all the things  that  do not  matter. A p. cracks nuts  with  a steam hammer: that  is,  calls  in the first principles of morality to decide  whether  he may, or must, do something of as little impor- tance as drinking a  glass  of beer. On the whole, one may, perhaps, say  that all  his different characteristics come from the combination, in varying pro- portions, of  three  things—the  desire to do his duty, the belief  that  he knows better  than other people, and blindness to the difference in value between different  things.'",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Better, cer- tainly,  than a. p.  with  increment  1,  of which the fourth annual  term  would have been  10,003;  but as certainly worse than a. p.  with  increment a million, of which the fourth  term would have been  3,010,000;  and neither  better  nor worse than, but a case  of, a. p.  with  increment  13,333^. The writer meant a. p.  with  annual increment  10,000;  but as soon as we see  what  he meant to say we see  also that  it was not  worth  saying,  since it tells us no more than  that,  as we knew before, fifty thousand is greater than forty thousand. Even  g. p. may be so slow  that  to raise  10,000  in  three  years to as little as  the  10,003  mentioned above is merely a  matter  of fixing the increment ratio low enough.  Neither  a. p. nor g.  p. necessarily implies rapid progress. The  point  of contrast between  them  is that  one involves growth or decline at a  constant pace, and the other at an increasing  pace. Hence the famous sentence in Malthus about population and subsistence, the first increasing in a  geometrical and the second in an arithmetical  ratio, which  perhaps started the phrases on their career as",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

pronouns,"and pronominal adjectives are  tricky rather than difficult. Those who go wrong over  them  do so from heedlessness,  and will mostly plead guilty  when they are charged. It is enough to state the dangers very shortly, and prove their existence by sufficient  citations.  1.  There must be a  principal in existence for the pro- noun or proxy to act for. 2. The principal should not be very far off. 3.  There should not be two parties justifying  even a momentary  doubt about which the pronoun represents. 4.  One  pronoun should not represent two principals on one occasion.  5.  The pronoun should seldom precede its principal. 1.  No pronoun  without  a principal in  being.  Viscount  Wolverhampton, acting  under medical  advice,  has re- signed  the  office  of  Lord  President, and His Majesty the King has  been  pleased to  accept  it  (it  is resignation; but as that  word has not been used we can only  suppose  H.M.  to have accepted the  office).  /  Nozv, the public interest is that  coal  should be cheap and abundant, and that it should be got without the dangerous  friction which has attended the  disputes  between  masters  and  men in this trade. And, if nationalization is to be  the policy,  it  looks to an  assured  peace in the coal-trade as its main advantage. For  this  it  will pay a fair  price  and be willing  that a  considerable  experiment should  be made, but without the  sure prospect  of such a  peace  it  will see no benefit  to  itself  and a very doubtful  bene- fit  to  the miners in the change from private  to State  ownership  (Each of the its  in roman type means the public, not the public interest). /  The  number  of these  abstainers  is certainly  greater  than can be attributed to merely  local  or per- sonal  causes,  and  those  who  have  watched the  election  agree  that a  portion  of  them are  due to doubts and uncertainties about  the Act  (A portion,  that  is, of the abstentions, not of the abstain- ers).  /  An American  Navy  League Branch  has even been established in London,  and is influentially  supported by  their  countrymen  in this city  (Whose countrymen?). 2.

We  have  to go further back than the beginning of the following extracts to learn who  he  and  she  are: And yet, as we  read  the  pages  of the book,  we  feel  that a  work  written when the  story  is only as yet half told, amid the  turmoil of the events which  he  is describing,  can only be taken as a pro- visional  impression.

There  should not be two parties justifying even a  moment's  doubt about  which the  pronoun  represents. There is no doubt  that  the Home  Secre- tary is justified in law in issuing a deportation  order and therewith  goes  the right,  absolutely  within his discretion, to place  him in a ship or an aircraft bound for  a destination of  his  selection  (The Home  Secretary's selection or the deportee's?).  In the  December  previous to his raid on the Tower he was  chief of   a gang who,  overpowering  his attendants, seized the Duke of Or- monde  hi  St. James Street when returning  from a dinner-party (His refers not to the preceding  he,  but to the following  Duke;  see 5, and  FALSE SCENT).  /  Professor  Geddes's  fine exam- ple  of  sociology  applied to Civics, his plea  for a comprehensive and exact survey  of  his  ozvn city as a branch of natural history required for the culture of  every instructed citizen  (The pro- fessor's  own city?  Ah,  no;  here comes, perhaps  better  late  than  never, the instructed  citizen, the  true  prin- cipal).  /  As it is, the short-sighted obstinacy  of  the bureaucracy has given  its  overzvhelming strength to the revolution  (Not  bureaucracy's,  but revolution's, strength; see also 5). / Coriolanus  is the embodiment of a great noble;  and  the reiterated taunts which he  hurls in play after play at the rabble only echo the general temper of the Renascence  (Not  Coriolanus,  but Shakespeare, is the hurler; the  inter- loping of Coriolanus  between  Shake- speare and his proxy makes things difficult for the reader). 4.  One  pronoun,  one job . . .  which opens  up the bewildering question as to how  far the Duma really  represents  the nation. The answer to this is far from solving  the Russian riddle, but without answering  it it  is idle even to discuss  it (It  represents, first, the bewildering question, secondly, the discussion of that  riddle, and last, the riddle  itself— which is not the same as the question)./ This  local option in the amount of  out' door  relief  given  under the  Poor  Law  has always operated inequitably and been one  of the greatest blots on the  system; to extend  it  to the first great  benefit under the Insurance Act will greatly lessen  its  usefulness  (It  is the  blot,  but its  is the Act's). /  Again,  unconscious- ness  in the  person  himself of what  he  is about, or of what others think of  him, is also a great heightener of the  sense  of absurdity;  it  makes  it  come  the fuller home  to us from his insensibility to  it (It  is first the unconsciousness, second- ly  the sense of absurdity, and thirdly absurdity). 5.  The  pronoun  should seldom pre- cede its principal.  For Plato,  being  then about  twenty-eight  years  old, had  listened to the  'Apology*  of  Socrates;  had  heard from  them  all  that  others  had  heard  or seen  of his last hours  (had heard from others all  that  they had heard etc.). / The old Liberal idea of cutting  expendi- ture  down to the bone, so  that  his  money might fructify in the pocket  of the tax- payer,  had given place to the idea  of ...

In the article RE- CEIVED   PRONUNCIATION  (R.P.)  some account is given of the system of pro- nunciation  that  is regarded as correct for an educated Englishman. The article  RECESSIVE  ACCENT  deals  with  one feature of the  R.P.  that  calls for special notice.  The  present  article is con- cerned  with  certain trends now dis- cernible in our pronunciation and  with a  few particular points. 1.  GENERAL The R.P. has always been to some extent  conventional; the spelling of a",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
pronunciation,"word is not necessarily a safe guide to its sound. If, for instance, the con- ventional pronunciation of  forehead is  fô'red,  and of  knowledge nô'lïj, precisians  who try to restore the supposed  true  sounds of those words expose themselves to an imputa- tion of either ignorance or pedantry; the right rule is to speak as our neigh- bours do, not  better.  But pronuncia- tion is never static, and  there  are forces  at work today  that  make it more than usually subject to change. One of the forces is a movement, not springing from the vagaries of individual  precisians,  but more broadly based, towards  speaking words as they are spelt. This is a  natural result of the growth of popular education, of words being visible  and not merely audible symbols to far more people than they used to be, of the teaching of careful articula- tion in schools as an antidote to  slip- shod speech and local accent, and of the precise enunciation cultivated by some professional broadcasters. Modern dictionaries afford plenty of evidence  that  the  speak-as-you-spell movement is encroaching on many conventional pronunciations ; not only the older and more esoteric, such as that  hotel  and  humour  must not be aspirated and  that  girl  must be  gairl, Ralph  Raft  and  golf  gof,  but  also many others in general use. The experiences of  OFTEN  (q.v.) are typical; and those who say  for'tun  instead of for'chun,  clothes  instead  of   cloz, pik'tûr  instead  of  pik'cher,   and make six syllables of  extraordinary  can claim  the COD's recognition of these either as the now prevalent pro- nunciations or as admissible alterna- tives :  Regiment  and  medicine  are given their  three  syllables quite as often as their conventional pronunciations  rej- ment  and  medsin.  The same thing is happening to proper names.  Maryle- bone,  St. Mary Axe, Cirencester, Daventry,  and  Pontefract  are now rarely  given their old telescopic pro- nunciations  Alaribn,  Simeryax,  Sisiter, Dântriy  and  Pumfret  (see  10  below). To a  future  generation  forchun  and  clôz 483",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
pronunciation,"may  sound as odd as the once correct azvspitl  and  obleeged  do to us. The other force  that  can hardly  fail to have its effect is American pro- nunciation, now an  easy  second to the R.P. over the air in Britain, and markedly different  from it, espe- cially  in some of its vowels, such as sounding  o  as  ah  and  ù  as  oo }  and its more even distribution of stress. American influence no  doubt  ac- counts for the fact  that  Englishmen seem to be taking to  saying  rê'search and  defect  instead of  putting  all the emphasis on the second syllable  with a  hardly perceptible vowel sound in the first, and  also  perhaps for the increasing  number of words in which we pronounce  lu  as  loo.  See 6 below. A third  trend,  deprecated elsewhere in this book, is our greater tendency to give foreign values to the vowels in any  word, however well acclimatized in England,  that  has any foreign look, however slight. Even our Marias and Theresas are being  turned  into  Mare'as and  Therâ'sas.  For this see  FRENCH WORDS and LATIN PHRASES. 2.  SILENT  T With  the possible exception  of  pestle , the speak-as-you-spell movement has not yet made any impression on the large  class  of words ending in  -sten  and -sue  in which the  t  is not sounded (fasten,  listen, castle, bustle,  etc.).  But it is encouraging the sounding of  t  in words in which  -st-  is followed by a consonant. The COD now  puts  wasif)- kôt  before the once correct  wëskôt  and anyone using the  R.P.  is likely to give full  value to the  t  in such words as postpone,  coastguard,  and  dustbin.  On the other hand,  soften  shows no dis- position to follow the lead of  often,  or not enough to have reached the dic- tionaries. But  the convention  that  condones the omission  of the r-sound in many words gives  no excuse for the slovenly drop- ping of either  that  or any other con- sonant from a word in which conven- tion requires it to be sounded, such as (to take examples  that  may sometimes be heard over the air)  saying  fax  for",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

It was all very well for Miss Pinker- ton to tell her sister to put Becky's dixonary back in the closet, but the headmistress of today is expected to articulate more  carefully.  Artie  for arctic  and  strenth  for  strength  give the same  impression of slovenliness to the hearer, though in fact they  differ  by being old alternative pronunciations that  have gone out of fashion. 3.  SILENT  H In the first edition of this dictionary it was said  that  in many compounds whose second element begins  with  h the  h  is silent unless the accent  falls  on the syllable  that  it begins;  thus  phil- hellenic  and  philharmonic  should not sound the  h',  in  nihilism  also  it should be silent. Here too the speak-as-you- spell  movement has been at work, and though the COD does not favour the pronunciation of the  h  in these words, it is in fact often heard, and some modern dictionaries give it. See  also",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
"A, AN I, HONORARIUM, HOTEL, and WH-.","4.  A  AND  O The variations  ah  and  a  for  a,  and  aw and  0  for  o,  widely prevalent in large classes  of words  (pass,  telegraph,  ask, gone,  soft, loss)  are  largely  local dis- tinctions,  ah  and  aw  roughly southern and  a  and  o  northern,  with  o  tending to displace  aw. 5.  SHORT  O Short 0 in a stressed position, not content  with  vacillating between  aw and 0, is sometimes given the sound of  a short  u.  This is one of the many arbitrary features of our pronunciation that  defy all rule. It is not apparent, for  instance, to the ordinary man, though  there  may be an explanation known to the etymologist, why we should  give the  vowel  different sounds in  brother  and  brothel,  company and  compact,  colour  and  column, dozen  and  lozenge,  honey  and  honest, mongrel  and  mongoose;  or why, when the  o  is followed by a  v,  we should show unusual consistency in pro- nouncing it  u  with  only rare excep- tions such as  novel  and  sovereign.  All that  can be said is  that  the speak-as- you-spell  movement is likely to bring down on the side of  0  those words  that are still hesitating and probably  also some of those  that  now seem to have settled for a  u.  Among the words classed  as  hésitants  by the COD are:  (preferring 0)  Covent Garden, Coventry,  hovel,  hover,  pomegranate, sojourn,  and (preferring  u) combat, comrade,  conduit, Lombard. 6. LONG  U Long  u  may be pronounced either yoo  or  00,  and  what  determines the choice is not obvious. It seems  that we in Britain, unlike the Americans, prefer  yoo  unless difficulties of articu- lation deter us. It is not  easy  to say yoo  after  ch,  j, r,  or  sh,  and so we  fail back on  00  after those consonant sounds,  e.g.  chute, jute, rude,  and sugar.  No other consonant inhibits yoo  quite as much, and  with  most of the others it is standard:  abuse, acute, duty,  funeral, argument,  huge,  kudos, music,  nude, putrid, tune. L  is, how- ever, exceptional. It is not so difficult to say  yoo  after / as after  ch  etc., but it is  more difficult than after most other consonants, and  there  is clearly a movement going on, shared to a small extent  by  su-,  in the pronunciation of lu-.  It was formerly  de  rigueur  to put in the  y  sound; a  lute,  and even a  flute, had to be called  lyoot  and  flyoot,  not loot  and  floot,  or the speaker was damned in polite circles, just as Syoosan  was once the only genteel way of  pronouncing  that  name, and the dictionaries still give  that  sound for suit.  Some people seem to count the victorious progress of  loo  one of the vulgarities  of modern speech. Among these was the OED which  went  so far as  to prefer  glyoo  to  gloo  for the pronunciation  of  glue,  though it reversed the order for  blue  (bloo, blyoo).  For most of us, as the dic- tionaries now concede, anything but bloo  and  gloo  is surely impossible, however refined we like to be where the trials of articulation are not so severe.  Indeed, it seems clear  that  loo",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

pronunciation,"is  slowly but surely displacing  lyoo, helped no  doubt  by the general prefer- ence for the  00  sound in U.S.  What governs  its progress is not  easy  to say : there  is no apparent reason why  dilute and  prelude  should cling firmly to  y  00 while  delude  and  allude  are still hesitat- ing  and  conclude  and  recluse  are com- plete  converts to  00,  or why  aluminium should be  y00  and  aluminous  00. 7.  -ER-  OR  -UR- What  should be the vowel sounds in participles and other inflexions and derivatives  containing  -err-  or  -urr-} Is  erring,  for instance, to have the same vowel sound as  err,  or does it change to  that  of  error}  Is the vowel sound in  furry  and  currish  to be  that  of  err  or that  of  hurry}  The OED is nearly but not quite consistent; in the words  con- curring,  currish,  demurring,  deterring, erring,  furry,  purring,  slurring,  and spurring  the  err  sound is prescribed; recurring,  recurrence,  and  occurrence, however, are to be  said  like  hurry. It may be taken  that  the  err  sound is the orthodox one.  Demurrer  has two pronunciations : as  hurry  for the  legal term  and as  err  for the person who demurs. 8.  AL  FOLLOWED BY A CONSONANT Al  followed by a consonant is pro- nounced in six different ways:  âl,  as in  calculate;  awl  (or  ol)  as in  altar; aw, as  in  walk; ah,  as in  almond; a,  as in salmon;  and  â  as in  Ralph  and  half- penny.  Where  such a combination occurs in a word  that  is a syncopated compound  of  all  (albeit,  also,  altogether, etc.) the pronunciation is always  awl. Elsewhere  it varies capriciously. With  B it is  al (Albania,  albatross)  or, rarely,  awl  (Albany,  Talbot).  With hard C and K it is  aw  in words ending  k (talk, walk,  etc.) and, ordin- arily,  in  falcon;  elsewhere it is  âl (talc,  balcony, Dalkeith, alkali)  or rarely  awl  (Balkan  and, sometimes, falcon).  With  D it is  awl (bald,  alder) or, rarely  àl  (aldehyde).  With  F and PH  it is  ah  in  calf  and  half  and their compounds; in others  âl  (Alfred, alphabet)  or rarely  awl (palfrey)  and, exceptionally,  â  in the syncopated pronunciation of  halfpenny  and the old  pronunciation of  Ralph.  With  G it is  âl  (algebra,  hidalgo).  With  L it is  awl in  words ending  -all (call, fall,  etc.) and  their compounds and inflexions but elsewhere  âl  (ballot,  callous).  (The long  a  in  Balliol  comes from the old spelling  Baliol.)  With  M it is  ah (alms, palm)  with  variants  azvl (almanac),  âl (halma)  and  â (salmon).  With  N it is rare and unruly:  awl  in  walnut, ah  in Calne,  and  âl  in the  èa/ne-compounds. With  P it is  âl  (alpaca, scalp)  but  awl in  Walpole.  In the few words in which it occurs  with  R it is  awl (Alresford,  walrus).  With  S and soft C it is ordinarily  awl (false, palsy)  but sometimes  âl  (halcyon,  Alsatia, salsify). With  T it is  awl  (or  ol) (salt, falter) with  some  âl  exceptions (see below). With  V it is  ah  in inflexions of the words ending  -alf  (halve,  calve)  other- wise  âl  (valve,  salvo)  but  awl  in Malvern. The commonest mistake is the mis- pronunciation of  alt  by  speakers  who forget  that  in some words it is  alt instead  of the normal  awlt.  These are words derived from the Latin adjec- tive  altus  such as  alto  and  altitude,  the alter  of  alter ego  and  altruism  and its kindred. 9.  OUGH This combination of letters has de- servedly  become the  classic  example of the notorious inconsequence of Eng- lish  spelling. There are nine different ways  of  saying  it :  ô  as in  though,  00  as in  through,  ow  as in  bough,  aw  as in ought,  off  (ox  awf)  as in  cough,  uffas  in rough,  ok  as in  hough,  ôch  as in  lough and  an indeterminate  er  sound as in borough.  A  tenth  might be added (up)  if it were not  that  hiccough  is merely a misspelling of  HICCUP.  Most of  the words containing  ough  are fami- liar,  and their pronunciation estab- lished,  however unreasonably. A few exceptions will be found in their dic- tionary places. See for instance  HOCK (for  hough),  LOUGH,  SLOUGH, SOUGH, and  TROUGH.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The list  that  follows gives  some examples; more will be found in an appendix to the COD. In titles and surnames these curiosities are  naturally more persistent than in place-names,  where the speak-as-you- spell  movement is eroding  them  (see section  1  above). But even among the former this is beginning to tell. The Pepys  family are now not  Peeps  but Peppiss;  the Auchinlecks no longer call themselves  Affleck  as they did in Boswell's  day, and the Dalziels and Menzieses  who pronounce their names as  they are spelt must  outnumber  those who are still the traditional  DëëV  and Mingis.

proportion.,"It has been recorded as a  common  MISAPPREHENSION  that  p.  is a  sonorous improvement upon  part. What  was meant  will  be plain from the following  examples, in all of which the word has been wrongly used because the writers, or others whom they ad- mire and imitate, cannot resist the im- posing  trisyllable; the greater  part, most, etc., should be substituted.  The greater  proportion  of these old hands have  by  this time already  dropped  out; it is estimated that only 25,000 of them remain  now  (Most of). /  A few years  ago the  largest  proportion  of the meat  coming through  Smithfield  had its  origin  in the United  States  (the greater part). / There  was a  large  and fashionable audience,  and, as might be  expected,  the greater  proportion  of them  were  natives of  India  (most of them). /  By far the",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
proportion,"487 largest  proportion  of  applications  for using  the  machinery  of the Act  came from  the  employees  (the  most applica- tions).  /  The  larger  proportion  of the children  received  are  those  of  unmarried mothers  (Most  of). 'The  word  has  been wrongly used.' It  is not  merely  that  here  are two words, each  of  which would  give  the sense  equally well,  and  that  the  writer has  unwisely  allowed  LOVE  OF  THE  LONG WORD  to  decide  the  choice  for him. Proportion  does  not  give  the  sense so  well  as  part.  Where  p.  does  so far  agree  in  sense  with  part  that  the question  of  an  exchange  between  them is  possible,  i.e.  where  it  means  not a ratio  but a  quota  or  amount, there  is nevertheless  a  clear difference between them.  A  proportion  is  indeed  a  part, but  a  part viewed  in  a  special light, viz. as  having  a  quantitative relation  to its whole comparable  with  the  same rela- tion between some analogous whole and  part. Thus  a man who out of an income  of  £1000  spends  £4°°  upon house-rent  is  rightly  said  to  spend  a large  p. of  his income  on  rent,  if it is known  that  most people's rent  is  about 1/5  of  their income;  p.  is  there  a  more precise  and  better  word than  part,  just because  other ratios exist  for  compari- son.  But  to  say  'A  large  p.  [instead  of a  large  part]  of  these statements  is un- verified',  where there  is no  standard  of what ratio  the  verified facts bear  to the unverified  in  most statements, is  to  use a  worse long word instead  of a  better short one. The case  is  much stronger against  p. when  it is  accompanied,  as in the ex- tracts given above, by  a  comparative  or superlative  (greater,  largest,  etc.) show- ing  that  the  comparison implied  by  p. is  not  between two ratios (e.g. between the ratio  of the  part  in  question  to the whole  in  question  and  that  of  some other part  to  some other whole)  but simply  between  the two  parts into which  one  whole  is  divided.  Of  these two parts  of  course  one is  greater  or less  than  or  equal  to the  other,  but  that relation  is  adequately given by  greater etc.  part,  and  only confused  by the dragging  in  of the comparison of ratios",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
proposition,"expressed by  p.  It is a  clumsy blunder to  use  words like  greater  and  largest with  p.  when  the  comparison  is be- tween  the  parts  of  one whole  and not between  the  ratios borne  by  parts  of different wholes  to  their respective wholes.  To  give  contrasted examples of  the wrong  and the  right :  We  passed the  greater  proportion  of  our candidates is  wrong; read  part.

protest,"whatever to any of those meanings, and almost certainly owes  them  to the mistaking of the first syllable (repre- senting Greek  vpuros  first) for  pro  on behalf  of—a  mistake made easy by the accidental resemblance to  antagonist. ' Accidental*,  since the Greek  aycovioTrjs, the second  part  of  both  compounds, has  different meanings  in  the two words, in  antagonist  combatant, but in  pro- tagonist  play-actor. The  Greek •npcorayoi- viorrjs  means the actor who takes the chief  part  in a  play—a  sense readily admitting of figurative application to the most conspicuous personage in any affair.  The deuteragonist and tritago- nist take parts of second and  third importance, and to talk of several protagonists, or of a chief p. or the like,  is an absurdity as great, to anyone who knows Greek, as to call a man the p. of a cause or of a person, instead of the p. of a drama or of an affair. It is now a rarity to  meet  p.  in a legitimate sense;  but two examples of it are put first in the following collection. All the others are (for Greek scholars, who perhaps do not matter) outrages on this learned-sounding word, because some of  them  distinguish  between chief  pp. and others who are not chief, some state or imply  that  there  are more pp. than one in an affair, and the rest use  p.  as a mere synonym for  advocate. Legitimate uses:  In  Jeppë  the sub- sidiary  personages  do little  more  than give  the p. his cues.  /  Marco Landi, the p.  and narrator of a story which is skil- fully contrived and excellently told, is a fairly  familiar type of  soldier  of fortune. Pro-  and ant- in contrast:  Protagon- ists and antagonists  make  a point of ignoring  evils which militate against their  ideals. Absurd uses  with  chief  tie.  :  The  chief p.  is a young Nonconformist minister.  / It  presents  a spiritual conflict,  centred about  its two  chief  pp.,  ('co-starring' them,  no doubt)  but shared in by all its  characters. Absurd plural uses:  By a tragic but rapid  process  of elimination most of the pp.  have now been  removed,  j As on a stage  where all the pp. of a drama assemble  at the end of the last act.  /  The pp.  in the drama, which has the motion and  structure  of a Greek tragedy, are .. . (Fie!  fie! a Greek tragedy and pp.?). Confusions  with  advocate  etc.:  En- thusiastic p. of militant Protestantism.  / It  was  a happy thought that placed in the hands of the son of one of the  great pp.  of Evolution the materials for the biography  of another.  /  But most  of  the pp.  of this demand have since shifted their  ground. It was admitted above  that  we need perhaps not consider the Greek scho- lar's  feelings  ;  he has many advantages over the rest of us, and cannot  expect that  in addition he shall be allowed to forbid us a word  that  we find useful. Is  it useful? Or is it merely a  preten- tious blundering  substitute  for words that  are useful?  Pro-  in  protagonist  is not the opposite  of  anti-;  -agonist  is not the same as in  antagonist',  advocate  and champion  and  defender  and  combatant are  better  words for the wrong senses given  to  p.,  and  p.  in its right sense of the  (not a) chief actor in an affair has still  work to do if it  could  only be allowed to  mind  its own business. But in the  time  that  has passed since  the above was  written  there  has been little  sign  of its being allowed to do so. Forty years later we may come across  such examples as these almost any  day:  The Bishop of Bath was the Crown's  chief  p. against the Church courts.  /  Do the  Channel  bridge  pp. suppose  that navigational interests will allow  the  littering  of the waterway with obstacles  at every  2$o  yards?

No brief definition  of  these terms would  be  likely  to  command universal assent;  the  disorders  of the  human mind are  too  multifarious,  and  still  too mysterious,  to  admit  of  sharp  classifi- cation.

(The  Mental Health Act  1959  tries  to  remove this reproach by  denning  the condition as  a  persistent disorder  of  personality which results in  abnormally  aggressive  or  seriously irresponsible conduct.)  But  there seems  to be  fairly general agreement that  psychotic  alone  of the  three  can properly  be  used  of  mental derange- ment  amounting  to  insanity.

purpose,"fabrications,  f An  alternative,  briefer, and much  more  probable  account  of the  Controversial  Parts  of  the Dialogue Purported  to be  Recorded  in the Re- public  of  Plato.  Though  the  verb  is an old one,  there  is  in  the OED quotations only  one  passive  use, and  that  dated 1894.  The  above extracts are doubtless due  to the  corrupting influence  of the DOUBLE  PASSIVE;  that  construction  is especially  gratuitous  with  p.,  the  sense of  which fits  it to  serve,  in the  active, as  a  passive  to  suppose,  represent,  etc. In  all the  extracts  supposed  would stand; pretentiousness  has  suggested purport  as  a  less  familiar and therefore more imposing verb,  and  ignorance has  chosen  the  wrong  part  of it  (pur- ported)  instead of the  right  (purporting). The first idiomatic limitation,  then, is  that  the  verb, though  not  strictly in- transitive only, should never  be  used in  the  passive.  The  second  is  that  the subject, which  is  seldom  a  person  at all,  should  at  any rate  not be a  person as  such—only  a  person viewed  as a phenomenon  of  which  the  nature  is indicated  by  speech, actions,  etc., as the nature  of a  document  is  indicated by  its  wording.

The  colloquial formula 'quite  all right'  is an  apparent  PLEONASM,  quite and  all  being identical  in  sense  ;  'quite right'  is  all right, and 'all right'  is  quite right,  but  'quite  all  right'  is all  quite wrong, unless indeed  all  right  is  here used  in its  sense  of  adequate  but no more,  and  quite  is  added  for  reassur- ance.  3.

In  (b), choice  is  open; quite  will amount  to  quite  absurd  (as  in (a));  quite so  will amount  to  it is  quite as  you say,  and the  general effect  of each  is the  same.  In  (c),  quite  would be wrong, because  the  other speaker's words  do not  supply anything,  as in (a)  and (b), for  quite  to  qualify;  the sense  is  clearly  not  he quite did  it,  but, as  in the  second alternative  of  (b),  it is quite  as you  say.

quotation.,"Didactic and polemical writers quote  passages  from others to support themselves by authority  or  to provide themselves  with  something to  controvert;  critics quote from the books they review in illustration of their estimates. These are matters  of  business on which no general advice need be offered. But the literary or decorative quotation is another thing. A writer expresses  himself in words  that  have been used before because they  give  his meaning  better  than he can  give  it himself, or because they are beautiful or  witty,  or because he expects  them to touch a chord of association in his reader, or because he wishes to show that  he is learned or well read. Quota- tions due to the last motive are in- variably  ill advised. The discerning reader detects it and is contemptuous ; the undiscerning is perhaps impressed, but even  then  is at the same time repelled, pretentious quotations being the surest road to tedium. The  less experienced a writer is, and therefore on the whole the  less  well read he is also,  the more  is  he  tempted  to this error. The experienced knows he had better  avoid  it  ; and the well-read, aware that  he could quote if he would, is not afraid  that  readers will think he cannot. Quoting for association's sake has more chance of success, or at any rate less  certainty of failure; but it needs a  homogeneous audience. If a jest's prosperity lies in the ear of him  that hears  it, so too does a quotation's ; to each reader those quotations are agree- able  that  neither strike him as hack- neyed nor rebuke his ignorance by their complete novelty, but rouse dor- mant memories. Quotation,   then, should be adapted to  the  probable reader's  degree of cultivation, which presents a very  pretty  problem to those who have a mixed audience to face; the  less  mixed the audience, the safer is  it to quote for association.

MISQUOTATION.,"PRETENTIOUSNESS In the summer of  1867  England re- ceived  with  strange  welcome  a  strange visitor.  'Quis  novus his nostris suc- cessit  sedibus hospes?'

The verbs  that  can mean either to deprive of  or to provide  with  what is expressed by  the noun of the same spelling (compare  will but skin and film the ulcerous  place  with  skin 'em alive)  are not parallel, because  with  them  the noun is the starting-point. raze,  rase.  Rase  is the older spelling, but  raze  now prevails. There is some tendency to use  rase  still for  senses, such as erase or scrape off,  that  are now archaic; but the distinction corre- sponds  to no difference of etymology, and  raze  should be the only form. re.

In re- compounds the hyphen is usual before  e,  though seldom necessary, {re-entrant,  re-examine,  etc.) but not before other vowels  (rearmament, re- iterate,  reorganize,  reunion).  It is some- times used when the compound fol- lows  the simple verb  (make and re- make,  discussion  and  re-discussion)  and it is necessary when a compound such as  re-cover  = to put a new cover  upon, re-count  =  count   again,   re-form  =» form afresh,  re-sign  =  sign  again,  is to be distinguished from a  better- known and differently pronounced old word  (recover  =  get back,  recount  = narrate,  reform  =  improve, and  resign =  relinquish).  See  HYPHENS. 2.  Pronunciation. In Latin the  e  is short. That is not necessarily a guide to its pronunciation in  English  (see FALSE  QUANTITY)  but in  this  case  we do in  fact ordinarily conform. The main exceptions are (a) where the  verb  to which  re-  is prefixed begins  with  a vowel (for examples see above) and (b) to emphasize  that  the prefix is having  a significant effect on a com- mon verb, not only, as in the extreme examples given above, to reinforce the hyphen as a protection against mis- understanding, but often  also  where there is no risk of ambiguity  (recapture, recharge,  regroup,  retouch,  etc.). It seems,  however,  that  there is a modern tendency to  give  the  ê  sound to words that  were formerly pronounced  ë. Among words for which the SOED gave  only  ë  but at least one modern dictionary  gives  only  ë  are  reclaim, regenerate,  repair,  repeal,  replace,  re- plenish.  This may be partly due to U.S.   influence, especially to the American pronunciation of disyllabic re-  words such as  research  and  recess. See  PRONUNCIATION  1.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
reaction.,"Darwin's  observations  upon the  breeds  of  pigeons  have had a  reaction on  the  structure  of  European  Society.  / Any apparent divisions in this country, even  the threat of a vote of  censure, might  have had its  reaction on  public opinion  in Italy.  Owing to its use in chemistry, r. has become a  POPULAR- IZED  TECHNICALITY  liable like other such terms  to be  used  by  SLIPSHOD  EXTEN- SION  where it  is  not wanted, e.g. where nothing more is meant than effect or influence or the simple action. This misuse  is betrayed in the above quota- tions by the word  on,  which suits action  etc., but does not suit  r.  except in  senses in which it means more than any  of those three. The senses of r. may  be distinguished thus:  1.  The process  of reversing what has been done or going back to the status quo ante:  progress  and r.; the  forces  of r. 2.  The recoil  from  unusual activity or inactivity, producing an equally un- usual  degree of the reverse :  extremes and r.  ;  the r. from  passion,  despair, a cold  bath.  3. The second half of in- teraction, B's retaliation upon the first agent  A, making up  with  action the vicissitudes  of a struggle etc. :  after all this action and r.  4.  The  reflex effect upon A of his own actions :  the r. of cruelty  upon the  cruel.  5. The action called  forth from B by A's  treatment: stimulus  and  r.;  the r. of  copper  to sulphuric  acid.  This last is the sense that  covers the chemical use, and the one  also  that  is often interchangeable with  effect  etc.  ; but  on  or  upon  is out of  place  with  it; not  the r. of  sulphuric acid  on  copper,  but either  the r. of copper  to sulphuric acid  or  the action of  sulphuric  add  on  copper.  Similarly, not the r., but  the action  or  effect  or influence,  of Darwinism  on  Europe and of  English  votes of censure  on Italian  public opinion. 6. A further extension of this too popular word is its use in the sense of opinion. May I have your r. to this  proposal? This is excusable if what is wanted is an  opinion given immediately  without reflection. But if a considered opinion is  asked for it is an example of slipshod extension at its worst.  It is  understood realistic that the  Governor  wishes  to  have  further consultations  with the authorities in London  before  formulating his final r. to  the  proposal.  We do not formulate our reactions; they formulate  them- selves  unbidden. 7.  Chain  reaction. A dictionary  definition  is 'Chemical reaction forming intermediate prod- ucts which react  with  the original sub- stance and are repeatedly renewed.' This is much in favour as a more suit- able  metaphor in these days than the old-fashioned  'snowball'.

But in practice  prescription  has displaced  both  of  them  as a name for the doctor's formula, and  recipe  is the usual  word for a formula for preparing food,  receipt  being left to its use as an acknowledgement of payment etc. These facts are  worth  mention because it is sometimes debated, idly for the most  part,  which of the two is the right word.

 pronunciation,"for  what was called 'standard  English' by  Sweet as long ago as  1908  and described by him as 'a  class  dialect rather than any local  dialect—the language  of the educated all over Britain'.  (Where  educated northern speech differs from educated southern, as  in the different value given to  a  in such words as  past  and  bath,  the  R.P. adopts the southern. Robert  Bridges's name for it was 'Southern  English'.) Wyld's definition was  that  it is 'the pronunciation of the great public schools,  the universities and the learned professions,  without  local re- striction'. But it is of course not con- fined to  them.  Teachers who use the R.P.  now  cover  a far wider field than 'the great public schools' and millions of  people listen daily to broadcasts in it, so  that  the scope of  that  pronuncia- tion, or something like it, is expanding and  that  of local variations corre- spondingly  contracting. Opinions about the merits of the  R.P. differ  sharply and are apt to be ex- pressed  with  curious acrimony. On the one hand, a Professor of  English  at Oxford (Wyld) has called it 'the best kind of  English,  not only because it is spoken by those often very properly called  the best people, but  also  because it has two great advantages  that  make it intrinsically superior to every other type of  English  speech—the  extent  to which it is current throughout the country and the marked distinctive- ness  and clarity of its sounds'. On the other hand, a Lecturer in  English  at Cambridge (Rossiter) has said of it that  'it is not the accent of a  class  but the accent of the class-conscious . . . the dialect of an effete social clique, half  aware of its own etiolation, capitalizing  linguistic affectations to convert  them  to caste-marks. ... Its taint of bogus superiority, its implicit snobbery make it resented. Its fre- quent slovenliness and smudge con- demn it on purely auditory grounds.' In America  there  seems to be a simi- lar  conflict of opinion about the way the 'best people' among us speak. On the one hand, the lexicographer Vize- telly  attacked the  R.P.  in  1931  as a",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 pronunciation,"'debased,  effete and inaudible form of speech'.  'The  best people of England today', he wrote,  'talk  with  the cockney voice  that,  leaving the purlieus of Limehouse,  has reached the purlieus of  Mayfair. This is the aftermath of the war, during which the spirit of democracy  prevailed, and the pronun- ciation  of the common people left its impress indelibly on the so-called best people,  with  a few languid drawls, terminal  azvs,  clipped  g's  and feeble /t's  thrown  in for good measure, which later acquired the name of the Oxford voice  [and] steadily debased the coin- age  of  English  speech  with  emasculated voices  and exaggerated  idiosyncrasies.' On the other hand, Professor Clark of  Minnesota  wrote  in  1951:  'Edu- cated Southern British pronuncia- tion certainly has unique prestige throughout  the   English  - speaking world. ... In America the  attitude toward [it] is in the strict sense ambi- valent. It is hardly an exaggeration to say  that  all  Americans envy the South- ern Englishman his pronunciation. The envy expresses itself in varying degrees  and in very various ways, sometimes by the appearance of loath- ing,  but it is envy still.' Whatever other inferences may be drawn from these discordant voices, there  is one  that  seems  pretty  safe: that  even men of erudition may find difficulty  in appraising  the  R.P.  dis- passionately;  class  prejudice creeps in  and colours the verdict one way or the  other.  It strains our credulity to be told either by Vizetelly  that  the  R.P. erupted  from Limehouse during the nineteen-twenties or by Rossiter  that it is a vestigial survival of the man- nerisms  of the Victorian fop,  which,  if we are to believe those who guyed him in  Punch  and elsewhere, consisted mostly of pronouncing  s  as  th  and r as  w,  dropping the terminal  g  from present participles and interspersing his  speech  with  haws  and  whats.  Nor is it any easier to believe,  with  Wyld, that  the  R.P.'S  superiority  to every other type of  English  speech is to be found in the distinctiveness and clarity  of its sounds. As R. W.

 pronunciation,"man has said:  'Of  all the charges levelled  against Standard  English  by Dr. Vizetelly and his  like—that  it was born in Limehouse, Mayfair or Oxford,  that  it is inaudible, emascu- lated, exaggerated, stilted,  and  chaotic, only  one is  gravely  embarrassing to its defenders.  The charge of careless articulation is serious indeed.' The charge of foppishness brought against  the  R.P. may be in  part  the result of its  giving  no consonantal value  to the  letter  r  except  before a vowel. In  hear  and  poor  for example the value given to the  r  is  that  of the indeterminate vowel sound  (er)  which in  lexicography is represented by an inverted e ;  hear  is  hê'ër  and  poor  pôô'ër. Drawling  speech may allow these to degenerate into sounds like  hê'ah  and paw'ah  and so excite justifiable derision, especially  from those who, like the Americans and the Scots,  give  some consonantal  value to their terminal rs. But  such noises are a distortion of the R.P.,  not a manifestation of it. The charge  of careless articulation  arises mainly  from our habit of concen- trating on one syllable of a word, or in longer  words sometimes on two, and leaving  the rest to take care of  them- selves  (see  next  article). The vowel sounds  of the unaccented  syllables  are thus  obscured, and  tend,  so far as they are  audible at all, to be given the  in- determinate  er  sound.  Bridges  used to fulminate  against  what  he called the derderderderdiness of our  speech  (sytn- perthy,  melerncherly,  melerdy  and so on)  maintaining  that  our pronuncia- tion was 'on the road to ruin' owing to the smudging of unaccented  syllables. On the other hand it can be argued that  uneven stressing is a central feature of spoken  English,  and  that  a pronunciation which conforms strictly to a spelling fixed probably two cen- turies or more ago is not necessarily preferable to a conventional one. Meanwhile the  R.P.  goes  its own way, regardless  of admonition. Its present trend,  for  better  or worse, is  undoubt- edly  towards more precise enuncia- tion of unaccented  syllables;  see",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 accent,"recessive  accent. The title of this article has been criticized on the ground  that  the word  'recessive' implies the existence of a tendency for the stress in  English  words to drift backwards,  syllable by  syllable.  It should not be so understood; it is merely a convenient label for the phenomenon described in the article. The accentuation of  English  words is finally  settled by the action of three forces  on the material presented to them  in each word. First, the habit, mentioned in the preceding article, of concentrating on one  syllable,  or in long  words sometimes on two, and letting the others take care of them- selves.  English  words of three or four syllables  are common in which there is only  one clear vowel sound,  corrup- tion  and  enlightenment  for instance. This habit is in marked contrast to the French equality of  syllables,  and is responsible  for  that  obscuring of the English  vowel-sounds which is the main count in the indictment  that has  been brought against the  RECEIVED",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
PRONUNCIATION.,"The second force is  R.A.,  the  'recessive accent', or the tendency to place this usually  single  stress early in the word. The most obvious illustration is what happens to the French words we bor- row;  château,  plateau,  tableau,  garage, menu,  charlatan, souvenir, nonchalant, and  hundreds of others, come to us with  their last  syllables  at least as clear and  fully stressed as any, but the ancient Germanic tendency to stress the  beginning of  uncompounded words soon turns  them  into  ska'to  and shâr'làtân  and the like. (The move- ment  of stress in longer words is more complicated. In a word  like  formidable for  instance the French, from whom we took it, would put a  strong  stress on the  a  of  able  and a secondary one on for;  English  first  puts  the main stress where the French secondary one was and  a secondary stress where the French main one was, and later  gives up the secondary one). Again, owing to our traditional preference for stress- ing  first  syllables,  words  that  were long pronounced in  English  with  stress on the middle syllable now have it on the first:  aggra'ndize,   compensate, contrar'y,  demon'strate,  eque'rry  be- come  a'grandiz,  com'pensate,  con'trâri, demonstrate,  e'kwëri. These  first  and second forces work well enough together, and, as they are always  extending  their influence and gradually  assuming control of new words, account for many of the variant pronunciations so much more numer- ous in  English  than in most  languages. In  deciding which of two renderings should be preferred, it should be re- membered  that  when  R.A.  has once opened an attack it will probably effect the capture, and  that  it is well to be on the winning side. But  working  against these forces is a natural repugnance to a rapid succes- sion  of light  syllables  hardly differing from one another. Hence come re- actions  about many polysyllabic words whose  surrender to  R.A.  is on record in the dictionaries. These tell us  that laboratory",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 and,"disciplinary  should be, and  Deuteronomy  may be, pronounced with  the stress on the first syllable and recriminatory  with  it on the second. These are not  easy  to say, and the attempt  is apt to result in the omission of  syllables— la'brâtrt,  di'splïnrt,  Dû'- trônmï,  and  recrim'inâtrt.  Such dangers are  dodged by the use of two stresses (dï'siplï'nâry,  Dû'terô'nomy,   rëcrim'- ind'tory)  or  by shifting the stress forward  again  (labo'ratory). For  this and other reasons the R.A., though it has made great progress, has by  no means won  its  battle. Differently stressed  pronunciations even of words about which the dictionaries have surrendered may still be heard on the platform and over the air. These can- not  be wholly due to the difficulties of articulation  that  the  R.A.  may present in  words of four or more  syllables;  for they include stressed penults in many three-syllable  words such as  communal and  industry.  Whatever the reason, it seems  clear  that  there is still con- siderable  popular resistance to the R.A.,  showing itself not only in re- fusing  to follow a shift of stress to the first  syllable  of a word but  also  in",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In most of the r. words used in adult life  the second half is merely a booster of  the first, so  that  if we know the meaning of the first we know  that  of the whole.  With  many not even  that  is needed;  they are self-explanatory. We do not have to consult a dictionary to know what Hotspur meant when he complained of being made to listen to such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff from Glendower, or King Claudius when he  doubted  the wisdom of having had Polonais interred in hugger- mugger,  or Fluellen when he opined that  there  was no tiddle-taddle nor pibble-pabble in the camp of Pompey, or Parolles when he told Bertram  that he would do  better  to go to the wars than to hug his kicky-wicky here at home.

The hyphened form should be restricted to actual reuniting  {The parts will re-join  if laid  close  end to end,  or  should be  re-joined  with  care). relation,  relationship,  relative. i.  These words, as terms of kindred, have seen some changes.  Relative started as an adjective meaning  what we call related, but, being used as short for related person, became a noun denoting a person.  Relation started as an abstract noun meaning our relationship (in its only right sense;  see  next  article); but, being transferred  from  the  abstract  to the concrete, came also to denote a person. We have had to take to  related and  relationship  because the others in their original senses have failed us, and we now find ourselves  with  rela- tion  and  relative  as two names for the same thing, only so far different as  -ive is  something  of a FORMAL  WORD  and -ion  the dominant  term. 2.  The word for one kind of relative — cousin —has  a curious history. The Latin  word  consobrinus  from which it is  derived means, etymologically, the child of a mother's sister, but was also used in the wider sense of any first cousin, or, in the  legal  phrase, cousin german.  Later the meaning was en- larged  to include any collateral relative more distant than  brother  or sister,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

relation(ship),"and the English word, sometimes affectionately abbreviated to  coz,  was used in the same way in Shakespeare's day  ('Me  uncle?'  'You cousin'). We have  now  restricted the meaning again and classified the relations properly so called  : my first cousins are the children of  my parents' brothers and sisters; my second cousins are the children of my parents' first cousins ; my  third  cousins are the children of my parents' second cousins,  and so on. My first cousin once (or twice) removed is the child (or grandchild)  of my first cousin, and so  on. It was formerly customary for the Sovereign  to call a foreign monarch cousin  {Our  cousin  of  France)  and to do the same to noblemen of his own country. Royal writs and commissions are still so phrased if addressed  to  a peer above the rank of baron,  with archaic  epithets  nicely graded. A duke is  Our right trusty and right entirely beloved  c,  a marquess or an earl  Our right trusty and entirely  beloved  c,  a viscount  Our right trusty and well- beloved  c.  See also  TRUSTY. The verb  cozen  is said by Skeat to be 'merely  a verb evolved out of  cousin*, i.e.  to claim kindred for one's own advantage;  'the change of meaning from  sponge  to  beguile  or  cheat",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

It approaches the concrete in the rather rare sense of a story or narrative, and it is fully concrete in the very  common sense a related person, i.e.  a son or  mother  or cousin or  aunt or the like. Now  sonship,  cousinship, etc., being words for which  there  is a  use, it is entirely natural  that  -ship should be affixed also to the word  that summarizes  them;  sonship  the being a  son,  relationship  the being a relation —with  the extension (due to the generalizing  sense of  relation)  into 'the being this,  that,  or the  other  relation', or 'degree of relatedness'.

remain,"any  of  its  other,  or  abstract, senses  is against  all analogy; the use  of  -ship  is to provide concretes  (friend, horseman, clerk,  lord)  with  corresponding  ab- stracts;  but  relation,  except  when  it means related person,  is  already  ab- stract,  and one  might  as  well make conmxionship,  correspondenceship,  or associationship,  as  relationship  from relation  in  abstract senses.  Of  the fol- lowing extracts  the  first,  in  which relationship  should have been used, shows how  that  word, when  it  is justifi- able,  may lend precision  to  the mean- ing;  the second  suggests,  by the writer's shifting  from  one to the  other,  that relationship  in the  improper sense has no superiority whatever  to  relation  or relations;  and the  others show  how needlessly  the  LONG  VARIANT  is  often resorted to:  The king was  therefore  not necessarily  of royal  blood,  though  usually he  was the son  of  the previous Pharaoh; the relation  of  Tut-ankh-Amen  to  his predecessor  is not  known.  /  Why not leave  the  relations  of  landlord  and fanners,  as well as those of farmers and labourers,  to  the  beneficial  effects  of  the policy?

Faulty repetition results from want of care;  faulty avoidance results from incapacity  to  tell good from bad,  or servile  submission  to a  rule  of  thumb —far  graver defects than carelessness. This article  is  accordingly  of  slight importance compared  with  that  in which the other side  of  the  matter  is presented;  see  ELEGANT  VARIATION, where  the  rule  of  thumb  against repetition  is  shown  to  have  the  most disastrous  consequences.  It  will there- fore be fitting to begin  with  an example (from Henry James)  of  deliberate and effective repetition :  /  daresay  I  fancied myself  a  remarkable  young woman  . . . but  I  needed to be remarkable to  offer  a front  to the  remarkable  things that  pres- ently gave their first  sign.

R.  was given a new specific mean- ing  during the second world war, when it was used attributively  with movement,  or by itself, sometimes pre- ceded by  underground,  for irregular operations carried on by the inhabit- ants of occupied territory against the invaders.  As a generic  term  it em- braces the activities of the bodies known variously as  GUERILLA,  partisan, maquis,  and  chetniks.  Guerilla war, defined by the OED as 'an irregular war carried on by small bodies of men acting  independently', was first ap- plied to the r. movement in Spain resolve during the Napoleonic occupation. It is  a diminutive of the Spanish  guerra, war. Partisan, an older word,  origi- nally  meant 'a member of light ir- regular  troops employed on special enterprises', but as early as  1706  was used for a commander who would later have been called a guerilla chief. In the Russian civil war it was the name given to isolated bodies of revo- lutionary forces, and in the second world war to those who took  part  in resistance  movements in occupied Russia  and Yugoslavia. Maquis was the French equivalent. It is a Corsican word meaning scrubland; a dictionary definition is 'Le maquis nourrit le bétail,  abrite le gibier et parfois les bandits'. The kind of country  that provided a natural refuge and base of operations for bandits in Corsica served the same purpose for the members of the r. movement in France.

To anyone  alive today it would hardly occur  that  closure  was on a different footing from  budget  or  motion  or  dis- solution  or  division  or any other par- liamentary  term.  As to 'the  kind  of revival',  the occasion may be defined as  one on which a name has to be found for  a new thing, and a question arises between a foreign word and a disused English  one  that  might well have served  if the thing and the word had been alive together. Another accept- able  revival is  the  substitution  of  Fore- names  for  Christian names  as the heading  of the appropriate column in certain returns and application forms required by government departments and local authorities. (See  FORENAME.) Another is the re-emergence of  DIS- ASSEMBLE  to  meet  the needs of the machine age — a word originally marked obs. in the OED but restored to current status in the  1933  Supp. For  another see  ASIAN.  Another is carrel  (a monk's study in a cloister) pleasantly  revived for a small apart- ment  or recess set apart for private use in  a public library. It is by no means uncommon for very ordinary  words to remain latent for long  periods. To take only some not- able  cases  in the  letter  B, the OED records such disappearances of  balsam (600  years),  bloom,  the iron-foundry word (600  years),  bosk  (500  years), braze,  to make of brass (550  years); but the reappearance of these,  except perhaps of  bosk,  was not so much a deliberate revival as a re-emergence out of the obscurity of talk into the light  of literature. It is only  with deliberate  revivals,  however,  that  it is worth  while to concern ourselves here —words  like  carven  (carved),  childly, dispiteous,  dole  (grief),  and  loan  (v.), or uses  of words in obsolete senses such as  egregious  meaning excellent or  enor- mity  meaning hugeness.  Carven  seems to have been disused for 300  years, childly  for 250;  dispiteous  (formerly despîtejous  full of despite, now  dïsj",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
revue,"525 piteous  unpitying)  for  200;  loan  (v.) and  dole  for a long time in England at least. Revivals like  these,  and those of obsolete  senses,  not to  fill gaps  in a deficient vocabulary as  closure and  disassemble  did, and as it has been suggested  (see  MAJORITY)  that  plurity might, but to impart the charm of quaintness to  matter  that  perhaps needs adornment, are of doubtful benefit either to the language or to those who experiment in  them.  Is it absurdly  optimistic to suppose  that what the stream of language leaves stranded as it flows along consists mainly  of what can well be done  with- out, and  that  going back to rake among the debris,  except  for very special needs,  is unprofitable  ?

1.,"As a technical  term  of English  prosody,  r. has a more limited meaning than its popular one. It consists  of identity of sound in the  terminal  syllables of words, from the last fully accented vowel to the end, but only if the pre- ceding  consonantal sound is different. Thus  greet  rhymes  with  deceit  but  seat does  not;  relation  rhymes  with  station but  crustacean  does not;  risible  rhymes with  visible,  but  invisible  does not. Words  that,  to judge from spelling, might have been rhymes, but have not in  fact the required identity of sound, as  phase  and  race,  love  and  move  and cove,  are often treated as rhyming, as indeed in some  cases  they once did, but are called imperfect rhymes. One- syllable  rhymes are called  male  or masculine  or  single,  two-syllable  female or  feminine  or  double,  three-syllable and four-syllable  triple  and  quadruple. 2.  rhyme, rime.  Nothing seems to be gained,  except  indeed a poor chance of  the best of  three  reputes (learning, pedantry, and error), by changing the established  spelling. The OED states that  rhyme  'finally established itself as  the standard form', and  that  the revival  of  rime  'was to some  extent due to the belief  that  the word was of native origin and represented OE  rim* (=  number).  Rhyme  is in fact the same word as  rhythm,  and ultimately from Greek  pvQpôs,  though it came into English  from French in the altered form  rime,  and was only later restored, like  many other words, to a spelling more suggestive of its origin. It is highly  convenient to have for the thing meant a name differently spelt from rhythm,  but  that  convenience  rhyme gives  us as fully as  rime,  while it has the other advantage of being familiar to everyone.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The  slang term  is often abbreviated: thus the slang  for  feet  is  plates  and for  trousers is  round  me.

rhythm.,"Rhythmless speech or  writ- ing  is like the  flow  of liquid from a pipe or  tap  ; it runs  with  smooth mono- tony from when it is  turned  on to when it is  turned  off, provided it is clear stuff; if it is  turbid,  the smooth flow is  queerly and abruptly checked from time to time, and  then  resumed. Rhythmic speech or writing is like waves  of the sea, moving onward  with alternating  rise and  fall,  connected yet separate,  like  but different, suggestive of  some law, too complex for  analysis or statement, controlling the relations between wave and wave, waves and sea,  phrase and phrase, phrases and speech. In other words, live speech, said  or  written,  is rhythmic, and rhythmless speech is at the best dead. The rhythm of verse is outside the scope of this book, and  that  of prose cannot be considered in its endless detail; but a few words upon it may commend the subject as  worth  atten- tion to some of those who are stirred by  the mere name to ribald laughter at faddists and aesthetes. A sentence or a  passage  is rhythmical if, when said aloud, it  falls  naturally into groups of words each well fitted by  its length and intonation for its place in the whole and its relation to its neighbours. Rhythm is not a  matter of  counting  syllables  and measuring the distance  between accents; to  that  mis- conception is due the ridicule some- times cast upon it by sensible people conscious  of producing satisfactory 526",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

rhythm,"English  but wrongly thinking they  do  it without  the aid of rhythm. They will tell  you  that  they see to it, of course, thattheirsentencessoundright,andthat is  enough for  them;  but, if their seeing to it is successfully done, it is because they are, though they do not realize it, masters of rhythm. For, while rhythm does  not mean counting syllables and measuring  accent-intervals, it does mean so arranging the parts of your whole  that  each shall enhance, or  at  the least  not detract from, the general effect upon  the  ear; and what is  that but seeing to it  that  your sentences sound right? Metre is measurement; rhythm is  flow,  a flow  with  pulsations as  infinitely various as the shape and size  and speed of the waves; and in- finite  variety  is not amenable to tabu- lation such as can be applied to metre. So it is  that  the  prose writer's best guide to rhythm is not his own experiments  in,  or other people's rules for, particular cadences and stress-schemes,  but an instinct for the difference between what sounds right and what sounds wrong. It is an in- stinct cultivable by those on whom nature has not bestowed it, but on one condition  only—that  they will make a practice of reading aloud.  That  test soon  divides  matter,  even for a far from sensitive ear, into what reads well and what reads tamely, haltingly, jerkily,  lopsidedly, topheavily, or otherwise badly; the first is the rhyth- mical,  the other the rhythmless. By the time the reader aloud has dis- covered  that  in a really good writer every  sentence is rhythmical, while bad writers perpetually offend or puzzle his  ear-—a  discovery, it is  true, not very quickly  made—he  is capable of  passing judgement on each of his own sentences if he will be at the pains to read  them,  too, aloud. In all this, reading  aloud need not be taken quite literally;  there  is  an  art of tacit reading aloud ('My own voice pleased me, and still  more the mind's Internal echo of the imperfect sound'), reading  with the eye and not the  mouth,  that  is, but being  as fully aware of the  unuttered sound as of the sense.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
rhythm,"Here, to conclude, are a few examples of  unrhythmical prose, followed by a single  masterpiece of  rhythm.  If these are read through several times, it will perhaps be found  that  the splendour of the last, and the meanness of the others, become more conspicuous at each repetition  :  Mr.  Davies  does not let his learning  cause  him to treat the paintings as  material  only to  be  studied by the Egyptologist  with a critical and  scientific eye.  Never  a chance of pausing, or an upward  or downward slope, in the four lines.  /  But,  so  far as I could  see,  nobody carried  away  burning  candles  to rekindle with holy fire the lamp in front of the ikon  at  homey  which  should  burn  through- out the year except for the short time it is  extinguished  in order to  receive  anew the light that  is  relit every year through- out the Christian world by Christ's vic- tory  over death.  Inordinate length of the last and subordinate  member beginning at  except,  which  throws  the whole sentence off its balance. /  But some  two  or three months ago I asked the hospitality  and  assistance  of  y  our  columns to  draw public and civic attention to the above  position of affairs, and to the fact that the use of the Embankment, as a thoroughfare,  was limited, and, in fact, almost  prohibited, by the very bad and deterrent  condition of the roadway at both  ends of the portion from Chelsea to Westminster, the  rest  of the  road  being fairly  good,  of fine  proportions,  and easily  capable  of  being  made into a most splendid  boulevard, for all ordinary traffic,  as a motor road, in which  respect it was dangerously impossible at parts, and as a typical drive or walk.  This writer  has produced a single sentence seventeen lines long  without  a single slip  in grammar.  That  so  expert  a syntactician should be rhythm-deaf is amazing. /  Some simple  eloquence  dis- tinctly heard, though only uttered in her eyes,  unconscious  that he read them, as, 'By the  death-beds  I have tended, by the childhood  I have  suffered,  by our  meeting in this dreary house at midnight, by the cry  wrung  from me in the anguish of my heart,  O  father, turn to me and  seek  a refuge  in my love  before  it is too  late!' may have  arrested  them.  Of  what  use to 527 riches talk of simple eloquence in a sentence contorted  and disproportioned like that? /  Let anyone ask some  respectable casuist  whether Lavengro was not far better  employed, when in the country, at tinkering  and smithery  than  he would have been in running after all the milk- maids in Cheshire/, though tinkering is in  general  considered a very ungenteel employment!, and smithery  little  better!, notwithstanding that an Orcadian poet, who wrote in Norse about 800 years ago, reckons  the latter among nine noble arts which he  possessed/,  naming it along with playing at  chess,  on the harp, and ravel- ling  runes/, or as the original has it, 'treading  runes*! — that  is,  compressing them into small  compass  by mingling one letter  with  another!, even as the Turkish caligraphists  ravel the Arabic letters!, more  especially those who write talis- mans.

 1.,"Except in the phrase  right away ,  the American use of  right  as an intensive adverb (even as an apparently indispensable reinforcement of  now) is  still not quite comfortable in England,  though  often used by en- tertainers imitating American  tech- nique. It is one of those usages  that were  current  when the American colonies  were founded and were preserved  by the  emigrants  but forgotten  by those they left behind. When  the entertainer  says  'I'm  right glad  to be here' or  'Good-bye  folks; I'll  see you  again  right soon', he is using  the word in just the same way as did the translators of the Psalmist's 'Then Israel should be right  glad'  and 'O  hear me and  that  right soon', and as  the  Queen  still does when she issues  a commission to one of her 'right  trusty'  cousins. 2.

sabotage.,"The  use  in  English  of  this French  word  (n. and v.) in the  sense of  malicious damage  by  workmen  to their employers' property dates from the early 20th  c. The  origin  of the usage  has been  attributed  to the  prac- tice of throwing sabots into machinery (cf.  our  'throw  a  spanner into  the works'),  or,  alternatively,  to  'the  cut- ting  of the  shoes  (sabots)  holding  the railway  lines' during  the  French rail- way  strike  of  1912.  Neither  is con- vincing;  there  is no  need  to  look  fur- ther  for an  explanation than  the figurative  use of  sabot,  at  least  a hun- dred  years  old, for any  scamped  or botched piece  of  work; hence  by the end  of the  19th  c.  sabotage  had  come to mean anything done maliciously by workmen, especially  by way of bad workmanship,  to  injure their  em- ployers'  interests. Once established  in the  English  language,  it  quickly  be- came  a  VOGUE  WORD,  especially  for the supporters  of any  project  to apply  to  people  who  successfully opposed  it—a  synonym  for  such words  as  obstruct,  frustrate,  wreck, destroy.  It is  properly used only in  contexts appropriate  to its  essential implication  of  malice  and  disloyalty; perhaps  one of the  reasons  for its popularity  is  that  it  enables  its  users to imply  a  charge  of  malice  without actually  making one. Even within  its proper implication  of  disloyalty  it is  given plenty  of  work  to  do.  In the General  Law  Amendment  Act  passed by  the  South African Parliament  in 1962  the  word  is  defined  as  including any  action  that  endangers  law and order, health, water,  or  electrical  ser- vices,  medical, sanitary, or  fire  services, food,  the  free movement  of  traffic and postal communications,  as  well  as damage  to  property  in  certain  cases, and  the  illegal  possession  of  weapons and explosives.

anti-Saxonism.,"Saxonism  is a name for the  attempt to raise the proportion borne by the originally  and etymologically English words in our speech to those  that  come from alien sources. The Saxonist forms new derivatives from English  words  to displace  established words of similar meaning but Latin descent; revives obsolete or archaic English words for the same purpose; allows the genea- logy  of words to decide for him which is  the  better  of two synonyms. Exam- ples of the first kind are  FOREWORD (earliest OED quotation,  1842)  for preface,  and  birdlore  (1830)  for  ornitho- logy,  and  BODEFUL  (1813)  for  ominous; of the  second,  BETTERMENT  for   im- provement,  HAPPENINGS  for  events, english  for  translate (into  English), FOLK for   people,  and  FOREBEAR  for ancestor;  of the third,  BELITTLE  for depreciate,  burgess  or  burgher  for citizen.   The  wisdom  of  this nationalism in  language—at  least in so thoroughly composite a language as English—is  very questionable. We may  well  doubt  whether  it benefits the language;  that  it does not benefit the style  of the individual, who may or may  not be prepared to sacrifice him- self  for the public good, is  pretty  clear. Here is the opinion of the  Dictionary of  National Biography  on Freeman's English:  'His  desire to use so far as possible  only  words which are purely English  limited his vocabulary and was  some drawback to his  sentences.'",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
say,"The  truth  is perhaps  that  conscious deliberate Saxonism is folly,  that  the choice or rejection of particular words should depend not on their descent but on considerations of expressive- ness,  intelligibility, brevity, euphony, or ease of handling; at the same  time any  writer who becomes aware  that  the Saxon  or native English element in what  he writes is small will do well to take the fact as a danger-signal. But  the way to act on  that  signal  is not to translate his Romance words into Saxon ones ; it is to avoid abstract and roundabout and bookish phrasing whenever the nature of the thing to be said  does not require it. Anti-Saxonism is not, like Saxonism, a  creed. There are indeed, properly speaking,  no anti-Saxonists. The  term is  here used as a name for the frame of mind  that  turns away not so much from the etymologically English voca- bulary as from the homely or the simple or the clear. It is a practice and a  propensity  that  go far to account for the follies of Saxonism.  Happenings and  birdlore  and  bodeful  and the like are the products of a healthy revulsion from the turgid taste  that  finds satisfac- tion in such words as  adumbrate, ameliorate,  and  eventuate,  and in the many other ways  that  are described in, for  instance,  ABSTRACTITIS,  AVOIDANCE",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

S.,  then,  can say in six  letters and in one syllable 'put tem- porarily  out of action but not destroy' —a  treasure, surely,  that  will be jealously  guarded by the custodians of  the  language,  viz. those who write. But  no; too many of  them  are so delighted  at finding in  s.  an uncommon substitute for such poor common words as  kill  or  destroy  to remember that,  if they have their way, the value of  a precious word will be not merely scotched, but killed and destroyed, or, as  they would put it,  'finally  scotched'. Finally  or  entirely  with  s.  should be, in view  of the history of 5., an impossi- bility.  But it is now to be met  with often in the newspapers  ;  and, after all, a  writer who, like the author of the first  extract below, does not know the difference  between a rumour and the contradiction of a rumour, can hardly be expected to recognize so super- subtle a distinction as  that  between wounding and killing  :  The  contradic- tion  of a  rumour  affecting  any  particular company,  although  it may have a  certain effect  upon the  price  of  shares  at the time,  is seldom  entirely scotched  by directorial  statements.  /  Nine months have  gone  by  since  the Crown Estate Commissioners  finally  scotched  rumours that  wholesale  demolition of the Nash Terraces  in  Regents  Park  was  contem- plated.

To write  as seem to be the  case  is al- ways  wrong, because the relative pronoun  as,  for which see  AS  5, never represents an expressed plural noun (such as  powers  here), but always a  singular notion like fact or state of affairs,  and  that  not expressed, but extracted out of other words.  As  seems to  be the  case  is,  then,  the only right form of the phrase; but even  that  will not do here, because it involves the doubling of two parts by  as,  that  of the relative adverb, indispensable after the preceding  so,  and  that  of the relative pronoun required by the otherwise subjectless  verb  seems.  What  has hap- pened is this. The writer wanted to say  if it has  powers  so limited as its powers  seem to be.

But,  since  so  makes the relative pro- noun  as  impossible, the  true  solution was  to let the  as  be a relative adverb, writing  if its  powers  are so limited as they seem to be. seemly.  For the adverb, see  -LILY. seigneur  etc. Spellings recognized in the OED are seigneur, seignior; seigneuress  ; seigneury, seigneurie, seign(i)orage,  seign(i)ory; seigneurial, seign(i)or(i)al.  The pronunciation in all  begins  with  s  an  followed by the  y sound. Differences in meaning or use between alternative forms (as  seigneur and  seignior,  seigneury  and  seigniorage) cannot be detailed here, but exist and are sometimes of importance. seise,  seisin. Pronounce  sëz,  sê'ztn. The words are sometimes (but  less often) spelt  -ze, -zin,  and belong ety- mologically  to the ordinary verb  seize; but in the  legal  phrases  to s. a  person of,  i.e. put  him  in possession of, and to  be -ed of,  i.e. to possess, the  -s- spelling  is usual. Mistakes are some- times made over the preposition.

Correct the first to both  I and  my  wife,  and the second to himself  and his family.  Such uses of  s. are  said  by the OED to be 'jocular or colloquial'  extensions of a 'commer- cial'  idiom (e.g.  your  good  self,  see COMMERCIALESE);  and,  unless  the jocu- lar  intent  is unmistakable, they are best avoided. So is the common use of  myself  for / or  me  when in  associa- tion  with  someone  else— My  partner and myself will be glad  to  see  you.  The use of  myself  without  / in the subjec- tive case  {Myself  when  young did  eagerly frequent)  is now poetical only. The word is best confined to its uses as a reflexive or for emphasis. /  have hurt myself.  / /  did it myself.  / /  can manage by myself.  I  I am quite myself again. But  when a personal pronoun has been preceded by the same word used as a  possessive adjective the addition of self  may make a sentence run more smoothly, e.g.  The difficult relations between  her father, her mother, and her{self). self-.

semantics,"is the branch of the science of  linguistics  that  is concerned  with the meaning of words. The name is modern; it seems to have come into English  from the publication in  1900 of  Mrs. H. Cust's translation of the Essai  du  Sémantique  by the French philologist  Michel  Breal  (1832-1915). Unlike the many scientific terms  that are  invented merely to  give  a new look  to an old concept, this one signified  a new approach to what had previously been called  semasio- logy.  Its progress was at first slow; all  that  the  SOED  said  about seman- tics in  1933  was  that  it was another term  for  the  older word. But,  largely through the work of I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden  (notably  their book  The Meaning  of  Meaning),  it has since been greatly  popularized, and, in spite of excessive  claims made for it by some enthusiasts, has established itself not only  in philology but  also  in philo- sophy and psychology. Postulating that  words  'mean'  nothing by  them- selves,  and  that  'the  kind of simplifica- tion typified by the once universal theory of direct meaning relation between words and things is the cause of  almost all the difficulties which thought encounters', it aims at remov- ing  the confusion between  'verbal' problems and 'real' ones and at fur- thering the use of words as instruments of  precision for the conveyance of thought from one mind to another.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The verb has been used for some  three centuries in philosophic writing as a comprehensive form of  'see  or/and hear or/and smell or/and taste or/and feel  by touch', i.e. of 'have sense- perception of. From  that  the use illustrated above is distinct, meaning according  to the OED definition 'to perceive, become aware of, ""feel"" (something present, a fact, state of things,  etc.) not by direct perception but more or  less  vaguely or instinc- tively'.  The OED's earliest example is dated  1872,  and the meaning has only recently become  part  of ordinary Eng- lish.  It has the advantage of brevity as compared  with  become conscious of, get  an inkling of, and other possibilities ; and  that  is no  doubt  the reason why it has  largely  overcome the irritation and suspicion  of preciosity which most readers  at first  felt—and  some still feel —when  confronted  with  it.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Formerly  sensible  could be used in all three  types of sentence; but its popular meaning  as the opposite  of  foolish  has become so predominant  that  we are no longer  intelligible if we say  a  sensible person  as the equivalent of  a sensitive or  a  susceptible  person,  and even  sensible of  is  counted  among  LITERARY  WORDS though surviving as a  cliché  for the opening of after-dinner speeches :  I am deeply  sensible  of the honour you have done  me. .  . .

sentence,"is defined in every grammar book and every dictionary, but it would not be  easy  to find two  that  gave  the same  définition,  and some of  them make heavy weather of it. Here are some  examples from standard works : 1.  A word or set of words followed by  a pause and revealing an intelligible purpose. 2.  A group of words which makes sense. 3.  A combination of words which is complete as expressing a thought. 4.  A collection of words of such kind and  arranged in such a manner as to make some complete  sense. 5.  A meaningful group of words  that is  grammatically independent. 6. A complete and independent  unit of  communication, the completeness and  independence being shown by its capability  of standing alone, i.e. of being  uttered  by itself. 7.  A group of words, or in some cases  a  single  word, which makes a statement,  or a command (or expres- sion  of wish), or a question or an exclamation. 8. A number of words making a complete grammatical structure. 9. A combination of words  that  con- tains  at least one subject and one predicate. 10.  A set of words complete in itself, having  either expressed or understood in  it a subject and a predicate and conveying  a statement or  question  or command  or exclamation; if its subject or  predicate  or  verb  (or more) is understood, it is an elliptical sentence. These definitions  show  a difference of approach, depending on whether  'sen- tence' is given its popular meaning of 'such  portion of a composition or  utter- ance  as extends from one full stop to another' (OED) or the meaning gram- marians  give  it of a combination of words in an analysable grammatical structure. Failure to distinguish be- tween the two has been the cause of much sterile argument about what the word really means. The first seven of these ten definitions take the 'popular' approach, the eighth and ninth the 'grammarians'.  The  tenth  tries to reconcile  the  two  by  giving  a gram- marians'  definition  with  a procrustean device  for fitting into it apparently unconformable sentences of the  'popu- lar'  kind. It is more realistic to admit that  the two may be irreconcilable; that  what may suitably be placed be- tween one full stop and another may lack  even an elliptical grammatical construction. Modern writers show greater free- dom than was once customary in what they place in  that  position.  And what of  the will to  power?  J Finally on one small  point.  /  So far  so  good,  j So  then.  / Now for his  other  arguments.  These, taken from scholarly writings by con- temporary men of letters, cannot be denied the right to  be  called sentences, but it would be straining  language  to say  that  they are elliptical in the sense that  'a subject or predicate or verb (or more)'  must be 'understood'. Gram- marians  are free to maintain  that  no sequence  of words can be called a s. unless  it has a grammatical structure, but they should recognize  that,  except as  a  term  of their art, the word has broken the bounds they have set for it.

 of tenses. I. A,"certain assimilation  normally takes place in many forms of sentence, by which the tense or mood of their verbs is changed to the  past  or conditional when they are made into clauses dependent on another sentence whose verb is past or conditional, even though no such notion needs to be introduced into the clause.  Thus,  Two will do  is a sentence; turn  it into a clause depending on  I think,  and the tense remains unaltered : /  think that two will do.  Next,  into one depending on /  thought  or /  should think;  it becomes  two would do;  after /  thought  there  is a change in the clause to past time, and therefore  would do  is not only normal, but invariable; after the conditional /  should think  the con- ditional  would do  is also normal. But this is not invariable, s. of tense being sometimes neglected and s. of mood often.  Two will  do  ;  /  think that two will do ;  /  thought  that two would  do  ; I  should think that two  (normal sequence)  would do,  or (vivid sequence)  will do.  (In these examples, the usually  omitted that  has been inserted merely to make it clear  that  a real clause is meant, and not a quotation such as /  thought 'two will  do'.)  The  point  to be noticed is  that the change of tense or mood is normal s.,  and the keeping of it unchanged (called  vivid s.  above) is, though com- mon and often preferable, abnormal. Further examples are:  He explained what relativity  (normal)  meant,  or (vivid)  means; I should not wonder if he (normal)  came,  or (vivid)  comes. 2.  Sequence out of place.  One would imagine  that  these  prices  (normal)  were, or (vivid)  are, beyond the  reach  of the poor;  These  prices,  one would imagine, are  beyond  etc. The base is  These  prices are;  if made dependent on  One would imagine,  are  may  be changed, or may not, to  were;  but if  one  would imagine  is a  parenthesis instead of being the main verb,  the  change is impossible. Never- theless it happens:  The  shops  have never  had such a display of Christmas presents,  but  here  again the  prices,  one would  imagine,  were  beyond the reach of  any but the  richest  persons.

Image cast  by a  body  intercepting light;  III. Shelter from  light  and heat. The most significant  point  is  that,  in II  of  shade, shadow  is  offered  as a definition  of  shade,  without  reciprocity in  II of  shadow,  the  inference from which  is  that  in  division  II  shadow  is the normal word,  and  shade  excep- tional.  This almost identity  of  mean- ing,  however, branches  out  into  a considerable  diversity  of  idiom,  one word  or the  other being more appro- priate,  or  sometimes  the  only possi- bility,  in  certain contexts.  The  details of  this diversity  are too  many  to be catalogued  here,  but it is a  sort  of  clue to remember  that  shadow  is a  piece  of shade,  related  to it as, e.g.,  pool  to water.  So it is  that  shade  is a  state— viz.  partial absence  of  light—and  not thought  of as  having  a  shape,  nor usually  as an  appendage  of  some opaque object,  both  which notions  do attach themselves  to  shadow.  So too we  say  light  and  shade  but  lights and shadows,  in the  shade  but  under  a shadow,  and so too  shady  means full of  shade,  but  shadowy  like  a  shadow. The  use of  shady  in the  sense  'of a nature  or  character unable  to  bear  the light,  disreputable' dates from  the mid 19th  c. Shakspere,  Shakespear(e), -erian, -earian,  -ean, etc. The  forms  pre- ferred  by the OED are  Shakspere, Shaksperian.  It is a  matter  on  which unanimity  is  desirable,  and it is un- fortunate  that  the  OED's verdict  has not been accepted  as  authoritative. But  the  preference today  is un- doubtedly  for  Shakespeare.  It is no use  trying  to  withstand  a  strong  popu- lar  current  in  such  a  matter;  even  the SOED  has had to  conform.

'To  use  will  in  these  cases  is now a  mark  of  Scottish, Irish, provincial, or extra-British  idiom'—Henry  Brad- ley  in the  OED. 'These  cases'  are of the type most fully illustrated  in  1  and 2  below,  and the  words  of so  high an  authority  are  here quoted because there  is an  inclination, among those who  are not to the  manner born,  to question  the  existence, besides denying the need,  of  distinctions between  sh. and  w.  The  distinctions  are  elaborate; they  are  fully  set  forth  in the OED; no formal grammar can  be  held  to  have done  its  duty  if it  has  not  stated  them, and their essence  is  briefly  sum- marized  in  WILL  (v.)  which should  be read  with  this article.  It  will therefore be assumed here  that  the  reader  is aware  of the  normal  usage,  and the object will  be to  make  the dry  bones live  by  exhibiting some sentences containing common types  of  violation of  it. The  'Scottish, Irish, provincial, or extra-British' writer will  thus  have before  him a  conspectus  of the  pitfalls that  are  most  to be  feared  if he  wishes to observe  the  English idiom  as described  by the OED. But it is necessary  to  add  that  the  position  is no longer  as it was  when Bradley wrote. The 'Scottish, Irish,  etc.  idiom', especially  as followed  on the  American continent,  has  made formidable  in- roads;  and  insistence  on the  rules laid  down  in the OED and  illustrated in this article may before long have  to be classed  as  insular pedantry. This  is regrettable.  The  English idiom affords a  convenient means  of  distinguishing delicate shades  of  meaning;  and  that  is a  valuable element  in a  language. 1.  Plain future.  In the  first person 'shall  has, from  the  early  ME  period, been  the  normal auxiliary  for  express- ing  mere futurity  without  any adventi- tious  notion'—OED.  Will  conveys  an implication  of  intention, volition,  or choice.  In the  following examples,  in which  there  is  clearly  no  such implica- tion,  the use of  will  is  contrary  to English  idiom :  This  is  pleasant  reading; hut  we  won't  get our  £2,000  this  year,  j 549",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Two other examples will provide  for a  common exception  to the  rule  that will  or  would  is the  colourless auxiliary for  the  first person.  In  sentences  that are,  actually  or  virtually, reported,  a verb  that  as  reported  is in the  first person  but  was originally  in the  second or third often keeps  vnll  or  would: People  have underrated  us,  some  even going  so  far as to say  that we  would  not win  a  single  test match  (the  people said You will not,  which justifies, though  it by  no  means necessitates,  we would not in  the  report).  /  He  need not fear that we^  will  be  'sated'  by  narratives like  his (his fear  was  You  will  be  sated,  which makes  we will  not  indeed advisable,  but defensible). 3.  The  verbs  like,  prefer,  care,  be  glad, be  inclined,  etc., are  very common  in first-person conditional statements  (/ should  like  to  know  etc.).  In  these should,  not  would,  is the  correct form in  the  English idiom.  But  here  would has  long been encroaching.  'I  would be  glad  to  receive some instruction from  my  fellow-partner'  says  Pompey in  Measure  for  Measure.  The OED (1928),  quoting this  and  other early examples, goes  no  further than  to say that  should  is  'regarded  as  more  cor- rect',  but  that  would  is  'still frequent'. It is now  evren  more  frequent—as  com- mon  as  should  if not  commoner.  Its",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 and will,"use  with  like  is illustrated in  LIKE  (V.) Examples  with  other verbs are:  We cannot  go into details, and  would prefer to  postpone  criticism  until.  . . /  Nor  has he  furnished me with one thing with which I  would care  to sit down in my little  room  and think.  I  If we should take a  wider view, I  would be inclined  to say that. It has been suggested (see  LIKE) that  the common use of  would  in the first person  with  such verbs may be partly due to a  confusion  between the modern /  should like to  and the archaic /  would  with  the same meaning. Another more general factor favouring will  and  would  is  that,  when the auxi- liary  is not emphasized, elided forms such as /'//,  We'll, I'd, We'd  are habitually used in speech and increas- ingly  in  print  (see  ELISION),  and these are naturally resolved into /  will  etc. Possibly  too the great popularity of that  curious Americanism /  wouldn't know  has had something to do  with  it by making / and  would  seem natural partners. Whatever the reason, it seems clear  that  attempts  to repel this par- ticular invasion from the other side of the Atlantic have now about as much chance of success as  Airs.  Partington had  with  the Atlantic itself. 4.  In clauses of indefinite  future  time, and indefinite relative clauses in  future time,  will  is now entirely unidiomatic; either  shall  is used, chiefly in formal contexts and  legal  documents or, much more often futurity is allowed to be in- ferred from the  context  and the present tense is used. This mistake is now  rare  ; but it may be  worth  while to give one or two examples :  He has now had to go clean  out  of  the  county  to  find  employment, leaving  his wife with her mother until he will  be able to make  another  home  for her (until he is able to make). /  So  long  as  this will  not  be  made clear, the  discussion  will go on  bearing  lateral  issues  (is  not made). / When this  will  be  perceived  by public opinion  the solution will immediately become  obvious  (is perceived). Here also  a borderline example may be of  service :  We have  strong  faith that a  rally to the defence of the Act will be a  feature of next year's  politics,  if the Tory Party  will  have the  courage  to come  into the open and  declare  war upon it.  An assurance from the writer  that by  will have the  courage  he meant chooses  to have the  courage  would be received perhaps  with  incredulity, but would secure him a grudging acquittal; has the  courage  is  what  he should have written. 5.  Shall  and  will, should  and  would, are sometimes regarded as good raw material for elegant variation.  'I  wrote would  in the last clause; we will have should  in the  next  for a change.' If  we found the instances invariably in mutual  support  we  would  be  content  with but a few, but if we found even one in contradiction  we  should  require  a  large body  of  evidence.  /  We  should  have  been exposed  to  the  full  power  of  his  guns,  and, while  adding to our own  losses,  would have  forgone  the advantage of  inflaming his.  I  You  shall  not find two leaves of a  tree  exactly alike, nor  will  you be able to  examine two hands that are exactly similar.  But the follies to which  ELE- GANT  VARIATION  gives  rise are  without number. 6.  77?ar-clauses  after  intend  or  inten- tion,  desire,  demand, be anxious,  etc., have  shall  or (more usually)  should  for all  three  persons. Among the etc. are not included  hope,  expect,  and the like; but the drawing of the Line is not  easy. Roughly,  shall  and  should  are used when the word on which the  that- clause  depends expresses an influence that  affects the result, as a demand does,  but a hope or a fear does not. In 'England expects  that  every man will do his duty', the substitution of shall  for  will  would convert an ex- pression  of confidence into an exhorta- tion. Examples of the wrong  will  are: /  am anxious that, when permanently erected,  the  right  site  will  be  selected.  / And it is intended that  this  will  be extended  to every division and important branch.  On the other hand,  will  in the next  quotation is justifiable, since here desire  cannot be regarded as affecting the result; it means merely  hope.

The ruling principle for Great Britain  is  that  -shire  is added when the county and its eponymous  town  (not always  the 'county' town) would other- wise  be identically named. (Sometimes the relation is obscured by change of form. Shropshire  reflects  A.S. Chron- icle  'Scrobbesbyriscir', i.e. Shrews- buryshire.  Hampshire  goes  back to Hamtun,  now Southampton.) But  there  need not be any eponymous town.  Berkshire  is  an  old  name  of which the first element means 'hilltop'. Flint- shire  has no Flint. The towns corre- sponding  to Dorset, Somerset, and Wiltshire are Dorchester,  Somerton, and  Wilton.  Where  the relation be- tween  town  and county is obscure, -shire  is optional, as in Dorset(-shire), Somerset(-shire),  but Duke of Somer- set. Berkshire is invariable but Devon (with  no  town  name) alternates  with Devonshire,  the shorter form prevail- ing  in  North  and South Devon and in picturesque phrases like Sunny Devon. (There is a Duke of Devonshire and an Earl  of Devon.) Durham is an exception, the county being  a relatively modern institution, and  never takes  -shire.   Cornwall, Cumberland,  Essex,  Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk,  Surrey,  Sussex,  and  West- morland, never take  -shire,  but good writers have committed Rutlandshire. Some  abbreviated forms are current in  writing, though little used in speech —Berks.,  Bucks.,Hants,  Herts.,  Wilts., Notts.,  Yorks. Salop serves for  both Shropshire  and Shrewsbury, and a member of Shrewsbury School is a Salopian. -shire  is never applied to an Irish county, though  there  is a Marquess of  Downshire.

 twins.,"This seems a suitable term  for the many words which, linked in pairs by  and  or  or,  are used to convey a  single meaning. As  with  the human variety, some verbal twins can be divided and each partner live sepa- rately; on others this cannot be at- tempted  without  fatal results. Their abundance in English is perhaps partly attributable  to  legal  language, where the multiplication of near-synonyms is  a normal precaution against too narrow an interpretation, and also contributes a pompous sonority to ceremonial occasions. A Royal  patent creating a peer,  with  a splendid prodigality of words, will  advance, create,  and  prefer  him to the  state, degree,  style, dignity, title, and honour of  his rank, and guarantee  that  he shall enjoy  and use all the  rights,  principles, pre-eminences,  immunities, and advan- tages  appertaining to it. The phrase- ology  of the Prayer Book, seldom content  with  one word if two can be used, may also have something to do with  it: in the  first  few minutes the congregation  at Morning Prayer will hear  acknowledge  and  confess,  sins and 554   sibling wickedness,  dissemble  nor  cloke,  assemble and meet  together,  requisite and  neces- sary. In ordinary writing Siamese twins are a fruitful source of  clichés,  and it may be  worth  while to examine a sample of the commoner of  them. Many  are merely tautological: a syno- nym or near-synonym is added for the sake  of emphasis:  Alas  and alack, betwixt and between, bits and  pieces, gall  and  wormwood,  heart and  soul,  jot or  tittle, leaps and  bounds,  lo  and  behold, nerve  and  fibre,  rags  and tatters, shape or  form,  sort  or  kind,  toil and moil. These are separable twins, but others, superficially  similar, are indivisible, either because one of the compo- nents is used in an archaic sense and would not now be understood by itself, or because the combination has   acquired a meaning  different from  that  of either component alone. Such are  chop  and change, fair and square,  hue and cry,  kith  and kin, might and main, rack  and  ruin, odds and ends, part  and  parcel,  spick  and span, use and wont.  Others  again consist not of synonyms  but of associated ideas (e.g. bill  and  coo,  bow and  scrape,  flotsam and jetsam,  frills and furbelows, hot and strong,  hum and ha, thick and fast, ways and means)  or of opposites or alter- natives (e.g.  cut and thrust, fast and loose,  hither and thither, by  hook  or by crook,  thick and thin, to and  fro).  Some are from the  law— act  and  deed,  aid and abet, each and every, let or hindrance, null and  void —and  some quotations or literary  allusions— fear  and trembling, hip and thigh, prunes and prisms, rhyme  nor  reason,  sackcloth and ashes, sere  and yellow, whips and  scorpions. A few can be  classed  as  HENDIADYS {grace  and favour —  gracious  favour, rough  and ready = roughly ready). Whenever a Siamese  twin  suggests itself  to a  writer  he should be on his guard;  it  may  be just the phrase he wants, but it is more likely to be one of  those  clichés  that  are always lying in wait to fill a vacuum  in  the brain.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

English  love of  euphemism, shrinking from the blunt  word  vomit,  has appropriated sick  to  that  use, especially predicatively (be,  feel, s.),  transferring its more general  sense to  ill.  But we still so use it attributively  (s.  people,  a  s. child, s. bed,  s. pay,  etc.)  and predicatively in the army phrase for declaring oneself ill,  go s.,  which has now entered civil life.

The object of each is,  at least ostensibly, to enlighten the hearer by submitting to him a case in which he has apparently no direct con- cern, and  upon  which therefore a dis- interested judgement may be elicited from him, as Nathan submitted to David the story of the poor man's ewe lamb. Such judgement  given,  the ques- tion will remain for the hearer  whether Thou art the man:  whether  the con- clusion  to which the dry light of dis- interestedness has helped him holds also  for his own concerns.

 and metaphor,"for  the illustrative story designed to answer a  single  question or suggest a single  principle, and offering a definite moral, while  allegory  is to be preferred when the application is  less  restricted, the purpose  less  exclusively didactic, and the story of greater length.  The Faerie  Queen  and  The  Pilgrim's  Pro- gress  are allegories. The object of a parable is to persuade or convince; that  of an allegory is often rather to please.  But the difference is not in- herent in the words themselves; it is a  result of their history, the most im- portant  factor being the use  of  parable to denote the allegorical stories told by Christ. It is  of  allegory  that  the OED  gives  as one of the definitions  'an  extended or continued metaphor'. But the com- ment  may be hazarded  that  there  is some analogy between the relation of allegory  to parable and  that  of simile to metaphor, and  that  the OED defini- tion would, if  that  is  true,  have been still  better  suited to  parable  than to allegory.   For between simile and metaphor the differences are  (1)  that a  simile is a comparison proclaimed as such, whereas a metaphor is a tacit comparison made by the substitution of  the compared notion for the one to be illustrated  (the  ungodly flourishing 'like'  a  green  bay-tree  is a confessed comparison or simile ;  if ye had not plowed  with my heifer,  meaning dealt with  my wife, is a tacit  comparison or metaphor); (2)  that  the simile is usually  worked out at some length and often includes many points of resem- blance,  whereas a metaphor is as often as  not expressed in a  single  word  ; and (3)  that  in nine out of ten metaphors the purpose is the practical one of presenting the notion in the most intelligible  or convincing or arresting way,  but nine out of ten similes are to be classed not  as  a means of explana- tion or persuasion, but as ends in themselves, things of real or supposed beauty for which a suitable place is to be found.

slipshod extension,"extent,  slaver  not going beyond sense 4,  while  slobber  covers sense 5 and even 6. The now much commoner word for to run at the  mouth— dribble —has  had somewhat similar expe- riences  with  drivel  (a word of different origin  but assimilated to it) and  drool (a contraction of  drivel),  which have retained their basic meaning besides acquiring  a  new  one—to  talk nonsense. slay,  though poetic or rhetorical in Britain,  is still in use in America, for  violent killing. It is a convenient word  for  HEADLINE  LANGUAGE;  slayer takes  less  space than  murderer.  For this reason it is likely  to  come back to journalistic  use  in Britain. It still makes  slew, slain,  not  slayed. sled(ge),  sleigh. Though all  three are  interchangeable,  they  tend  to be distinguished  in use as follows:  sled, drag  for  transporting  loads;  sledge English,  sleigh  U.S. and Canadian, for carriage  on runners.  'Chiefly  U.S. and Canada'  is the OED label on  sleigh', but the use of  sledges  in Great Britain is  comparatively so rare  that  the Cana- dian  idiom has naturally prevailed; sleigh  is always the word at winter sports. sleep.

To this heading, which hardly requires explanation, reference has been made in the articles on many individual words. Slipshod extension is especially likely to occur when some accident  gives  currency among the uneducated to words of learned origin, and the more so if those words are isolated or have few relatives in the vernacular; examples are  alibi, protagonist,   recrudescence,  optimism, meticulous,  feasible, dilemma. The  last  two  of  these  offer good typical illustrations. The original meaning of feasibleis  simply  doable  (Lat./acere  do); but to the unlearned it is a mere token, of  which he has to infer the value from the contexts in which he hears it used, because such relatives as it has in English—jfozf,  feature, faction, fashion, malfeasance,  beneficence,  etc.-—either fail  to show the obvious family likeness to which he is accustomed among families  of indigenous words, or are (like  malfeasance)  outside his range. He  arrives  at its meaning by observing what  is the word known to him  with which it  seems  to be exchangeable— possible,  and his  next  step is to show off  his new acquisition by using it instead  of  possible  as often as he can, without  at all suspecting  that  the two are very imperfect synonyms; for examples see  FEASIBLE.  He perhaps notices now and  then  that  people look at him quizzically as if he were not quite intelligible, but this does not happen often enough to prevent him from  putting  it comfortably down to their ignorance of the best modern idiom. The case of  dilemma  as a word liable to slipshod extension differs in some points from  that  of  feasible,  though a dilemma  is  confused  with  a difficulty just  as  feasible  is  with  possible.  A person who has taken a taxi and finds on alighting  that  he has left  his  money at home is in a difficulty; he is not in a dilemma, but he will very likely say afterwards  that  he found himself in one. The differences  are  first  that  the mere Englishman has still  less  chance than  with  feasible  of inferring the  true meaning from related words,  dilemma being an almost isolated importation from Greek; and second  that  the user need hardly be suspected of pretension, since  dilemma  is in too familiar use for him to  doubt  that  he knows  what  it means.  Nevertheless, he is injuring the language, however unconsciously, both  by helping to break down a serviceable  distinction, and by  giving currency to a mere token word in the place of one  that  is alive. He is in fact participating in  what  has been called the crime of verbicide. Slipshod  extension, however, though naturally more common  with  words of",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In many of the  articles  referred to, further illustra- tion of slipshod extension is given: Alibi,  anticipate, chronic, claim, com- plex,  crisis,  crucial, îdead  letter,  deci- mate, desiderate, dilemma, echelon, factor, feasible, identify, ilk, involve, level,  limited,  liquidate, literally, meticulous, mutual, nostalgic, op- timism, practically, proposition, pro- tagonist,  reaction, recrudescence, re- dundant, sabotage, scotch, shambles, shibboleth, significant, transpire, un- thinkable, as well as many of the words  listed  as  POPULARIZED  TECHNI- CALITIES  and as VOGUE WORDS. A stray example may be added of a word  with  which such abuse is excep- tional and apparently unaccountable. This will serve to illustrate the  truth that  slipshod extension is not the sort of  blunder against which one is  safe  if one attends to a limited list of danger- ous words ; what is required is the habit of  paying all words the compliment of respecting their peculiarities.  An excel- lent  arrangement,  for  there  are thus none of  those  smells which so often  disfigure the  otherwise  sweet  atmosphere  of an English  home.  What  has no figure or shape cannot be disfigured. Not  that the limitation need be closely pressed; we need not confine the word to a face or  a  landscape  ;  an action, a person's dic- tion, or a man's career (to take things of  which the OED quotes examples), can  also  be disfigured, because each of them  can be conceived,  with  the aid of metaphor, as a shapely whole.

small.,"Relations  with  little  are com- plicated,  and the  task  of  disentangling them  might excusably  be  shirked,  if not  as  difficult, then  as  unprofitable. But  examination  of the  differences  be- tween seeming  equivalent  ;  does  give an  insight into  the  nature  of  idiom. Under BIG some  attempt  has  been made  at  delimiting  the  territories  of great,  large,  and  big. Small  and  little have  to  divide between  them  the opposition  to  those three  as  well  as to much,  and the  distribution  is by no means  so  simple  and  definite  as the pedantic analyst might desire. Of  the  possible pairs  of  opposites let some  be  called  patent  pairs,  as being  openly  and  comfortably used with  both  members expressed,  and the rest latent pairs.  The  parent  pairs start  with  three  that  are  pretty  clearly distinguishable  in  meaning. Contrasts of  size  or  extent  are  given  by  large  and small;  'large  and  small rooms',  'of large  or  small  size',  'large  or  small writing',  'large  and  small appetites', 'large  and  small  dealings,  dealers'. Contrasts  of  quantity  or  amount  are given  by  much  and  little;  'much  or little  butter,  faith, exercise, damage, hesitation, study'. Contrasts  of  impor- tance  or  quality  are  given by  great  and small;  'the  Great  and the  Small Powers',  'great  and  small occasions', 'a  great  or a  small undertaking', 'great and  small authors'.  Besides  these,  the main divisions, there  are two  minor patent  pairs sometimes substituted  for one  or  other  of  them— great  and little and  big  and  little. Great  and  little  as a patent  pair  is  preferred  to  large  and small  in  distinctive names  ('the  Great and  the  Little  Bear',  'Great  and  Little Malvern';  Great  and  Little  Cumbrae; it  is  also  common  (see  below)  as a latent pair  in two  senses  Big  and little is  a  patent  pair often substituted  for either  large  and  small  ('big and  little farms,  motor  cars')  or  great  and  small ('big  and  little wars, ships')  or  great and little  ('the big and the  little toe'). The  patent  pairs  are  sets  of  opposites so  far  felt  to  correspond  that  one  does not hesitate  to put  them  together  as in  all the  examples quoted.  Or again  either member can  be  used when the other  is not  expressed  but  only implied;  e.g., 'the  Great Powers'  is more often used alone,  but 'the  Great and  the  Small Powers'  is  also  an ordinary  expression;  the 'Big  Five' depends  for its  meaning  on the existence  of an  unspecified number  of smaller  banks  and the  'little-go'  on that  of  an examination  no  longer called the 'great-go'. By  latent pairs  are  meant sets  of opposites  in  which  one  member  has the meaning opposite  to  that  of the other  but  could  not be ex- pressly  contrasted  with  it  without  an evident violation  of  idiom.  For in- stance,  no one  would  put  large  and little  together;  'large  and  little lakes' sounds  absurd;  but one  speaks  of 'a",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
smear,"565 (or  the)  little lake'  without  hesitation, though 'large lakes'  (not  'great lakes', which ranks  with  the  distinctive names above referred  to) is the  implied opposite. Another latent pair  is  much and small;  though 'much  or  small hope'  is  impossible,  and  'much  or little hope'  is  felt  to be  required instead,  yet  'small hope',  'small thanks', 'small credit', 'small wonder', are  all  idiomatic when  the  irregular opposite   much  is not  expressed. Similarly  with  big and  small;  we never contrast  them  openly,  but in 'the  big  battalions',  'big  game',  'a big  investment  or  undertaking',  the opposite  in  reserve  is  small. Great and little  was  said above  to  rank  both as  a  patent  and as a  latent pair.  In the latter capacity  it  allows  us to  talk  of 'great  damage', 'great  doubt',  'great hesitation',  and  again  of  'little damage' etc.,  but  forbids  us to put the  pair together;  it is  'much  or  little  (not 'great  or  little')  doubt'. smear.

"smell,","v.  1.  For  smelt  and  smelled see  -T  AND  -ED.  2. The  intransitive sense  to  emit  an  odour  of a  specified kind  is  idiomatically completed  by an  adjective,  not an  adverb;  a  thing smells  sweet, sour, rank, foul, good, bad,  etc., not  sweetly, badly,  etc. But the tendency referred  to in  UNIDIO- MATIC  -LY  sometimes misleads  the unwary into using  the  adverbs.  The mistake  is the  easier because  (a)  when the character  of the  smell  is  given  by 'of  so-and-so' instead  of by a  single word,  an  adverb  is  often added;  com- pare  smells  strong  or  delicious  (i.e. has a  strong  or  delicious smell)  with  smells strongly  or  suspiciously  of  whisky  or deliciously  of  violets;  and (b)  when  to smell  is  used,  as it  may  be, for to  stink, an  adverb  is the  right  addition— this water smells outrageously. Smells  dis- gusting  and  smells  disgustingly  are  both idiomatic,  but are  arrived  at in  slightly different ways,  the  first meaning  'has a  disgusting smell',  and the  second 'stinks  so as to  disgust  one'.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In print,  outside  dialogue, it has a cer- tain air of  silliness,  even when the context  is favourable, i.e. when the sentence is of the shortest and simplest kind (for this use of  so  is really ex- clamatory),  and the experience ap- pealed to is really general. Readers will probably agree  that  in all the following  extracts the  context  is not favourable.— In  the  case  of Ophthal- mology  in the  tropics  a  work  of  authority is  so sadly  overdue.  /  But he does com- bine  them ingeniously, though in in- stancing  this very real  power  we  feel that it might have been  so much  more satisfactorily  expended.  /  He was always kind,  considerate, and  courteous  to his witnesses,  this  being  so contrary  to what we  are led to  expect  from his  successors.  / Slade  would seem  to  have  some  of the philosophy  of his  kind,  as well as the technique,  which chiefly is the  reason why one  so hopes  he will not be rushed on  too rapidly. 4.

Now the  sobriquet  habit is not a thing to be acquired, but a thing to be avoided; and the selection  that follows  is compiled for the purpose not of  assisting  but of discouraging it. The writers most subject to  temptation are  sportsmen writing about the sports in  which they have excelled. Games and  contests are exciting  to  take  part in,  interesting or even exciting  also  to watch, but  essentially  (i.e. as bare facts) dull to read about. Such a writer, or the ghost he employs, conscious that  his  matter  and his audience are both  dull enough to require enlivening, thinks  that  the needful fillip may be given  if he  calls  fishing the gentle craft, a  ball the leather, a captain the skipper, or a saddle the pigskin, and so makes his  description a series of momentary puzzles  that  shall pleasantly titillate inactive  minds. Here is a  Times  re- viewer, who  sighs  over 'One sad fault, which runs through this, and,  alas  ! a good  many other excellent  books—the habit of seldom calling a spade a spade. Does it really help, or is it really humorous, to call the fox ""Charles James"",  a hare ""Madam"", a nose a ""proboscis"",  and Wales ""Taffyland""? Of  course, a sporting book will  tend  to use  sporting expressions; but a good deal  of this irritating circumlocution is  unnecessary, and might well be left for  colloquial use'. It is by no means  true,  however, that  the use of sobriquets is confined to this, or to any,  class  of writers; the Philosopher  of  Sans  Souci and the Bard  of Avon quoted above are from Thackeray and Conan Doyle, though they are unfavourable specimens of those authors'  styles.  Moreover, the sobriquet deputy has its  true  uses. Just as  Bacon  knows of  'things  grace- ful in a friend's  mouth,  which are blushing  in a man's own', so the sobriquet may often in a particular context  be more efficient than the proper name; though 'the Papal City' means  Rome, its substitution may be a  serviceable reminder, when  that  is appropriate,  that  Rome in one of its aspects  only is intended. Again, some sobriquets have succeeded, like  mayors of the palace, in usurp- ing  their principals' functions; the Young  Pretender is actually more intelligible,  and therefore rightly more used, than Charles Edward, and to insist  on 'came over  with  William I' in  preference to  'with  the  Conqueror* would be absurd. No universal condemnation of sobri- quets is therefore possible; but even the  better  sort of journalist, seldom guilty  of such excesses as the sporting writer, is much  tempted  to use  them without  considering  whether  they  tend to illuminate or to obscure ; 'the philo- sopher of Ferney', he  feels,  at once exhibits his own  easy  familiarity  with Voltaire the man  {Voltaire  the word, by  the way, is itself one of the  mayor- of-tbe-palace  sobriquets) and gratifies such of his readers as know who is meant. As for those who may not know, it will be good for  them  to realize  that  their newspaper is more cultured than they. The sobriquet style,  developed on these  lines,  is very distasteful  to all readers of discretion. Those who may become aware, in glancing  through the following alpha- betical selection of sobriquets other than those already mentioned,  that these and similar substitutes are apt to occur frequently in their own writing should regard it as a very serious  symptom of perverted taste for  cheap ornament.

 social.,"For confusion be- tween  pairs of adjectives in  -able  and -al,  see EXCEPTIONABLE, PRACTICABLE. No such  patent  misuses occur  with the present pair as  with  those;  there is  merely  a tendency to use  social  not where it is indefensible, but  where  the other would be more appropriate. Roughly,  social  means of or in or for or used to or shown in or affording society;  and  sociable  seeking or loving or marked by the pleasures  of  com- pany.  Social  is rather a  classifying, and  sociable  rather a descriptive adjec- tive: man is a social being; Jones is a sociable  person; people are invited to a  social evening, and say afterwards (or do not say)  that  they had a very sociable  evening. Obviously, over- lapping is likely. The OED, under a definition  of  social  that  includes 'sociable'  as an equivalent,  gives  two quotations in which  sociable  should have been preferred  {His own friendly and  social  disposition —Jane  Austen / He was very happy and  social —Miss Braddon),  as well as one  that  is just on the right side of the border  {Charles came  forth  from  that  school  with  social habits, with polite and  engaging  manners —Macaulay).",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

solder,"dictionary, especially  in  POPULARIZED TECHNICALITIES,  reference  is  made  to the harm  that  is  being done  to the language  by  this well-meant ambition (see  also  GROUP,  BRACKET).  Sociolo- gese,  like  COMMERCIALESE  and  OF- FICIALESE,  deserves  an  article  to  itself. Sociology  is a new  science  con- cerning itself  not  with  esoteric  matters outside  the  comprehension  of the  lay- man,  as the  older sciences  do, but with  the  ordinary affairs  of  ordinary people. This seems  to  engender  in those  who  write  about  it a  feeling  that the lack  of any  abstruseness  in  their subject demands  a  compensatory  ab- struseness  in  their  language. Thus,  in the field  of  industrial relations,  what the ordinary  man  would call  an in- formal talk may  be  described as  a  rela- tively unstructured conversational  in- teraction,  and its  purpose  may  be  said to  be  to  build,  so to  speak, within  the mass  of  demand  and  need,  a  framework of  limitation  recognized  by  both worker and client.  This seems  to  mean  that  the client  must  be persuaded  that,  beyond  a certain  point,  he  can only rely  on  what used  to be  called self-help;  but  that would  not  sound  a bit  scientific.  Or again,  still  in the  field  of  industrial relations, results may  be  summarized in language like this :  The  technique  here reported  resulted  from  the  authors'  con- tinuing interest  in  human variables associated  with organizational effective- ness.  Specifically, this technique  was developed  to identify and  analyse  several types  of  interpersonal  activities  and relations,  and to  provide  a  method  for expressing  the  degree  of  congruence  be- tween two or  more  of  these  activities and relations  in  indices which might  be associated  with available criteria  of organizational  effectiveness. There  are of  course writers  on  socio- logical  subjects  who  express  them- selves  clearly  and  simply;  that  makes it  the  more deplorable  that  such books are often  written  in a  jargon which  one is  almost  tempted  to  believe  is  delib- erately employed  for the  purpose  of making  what  is  simple appear  com- plicated, exhibiting  in an  extreme form  the  common vice (see  ABSTRACT- ms)  of  preferring  pretentious  abs- tract  words  to  simple concrete ones. It would  be  easy  but  tedious  to multiply examples  ;  two  will  be enough. 1.  (On the  reason  why the  'middle class*  speak differently from  the  'lower working  class'.)  The  typical, dominant speech-mode  of the  middle class  is  one where  speech  becomes  an  object  of  per- ceptual  activity,  and a  'theoretical attitude*  is  developed towards the struc- tural  possibilities  of  sentence  organiza- tion.  This  speech-mode  facilitates  the verbal  elaboration  of  subjective intent, sensitivity  to  the  implications  of  separate- ness  and  difference,  and  points  to the possibilities  inherent  in a  complex con- ceptual  hierarchy  for the  organization of  experience.  [The  lower working class]  are limited  to a  form  of  language use  which, though allowing  for a  vast range  of  possibilities,  provides  a  speech form  which  discourages  the  speaker  from verbally elaborating subjective intent, and  progressively  orients  the  user  to descriptive  rather  than  abstract  con- cepts. 2.  (On  family life.)  The  home then is the specific zone  of  functional potency that  grows  about  a  live parenthood;  a zone  at  the  periphery  of  which  is an active interfacial membrane  or  surface furthering  exchange — from  within  out- wards  and  from without  inwards — a mutualising  membrane  between  the family  and the  society  in  which  it  lives.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

'This  is  some  war', with  strong emphasis  on  some,  is modern colloquial  for  'This  is a  vast war', 'This  is  indeed  a war, if  ever there  was one'.  It is  still felt as  slang, and  it  comes  to us  from America;  but it results from  that  love  of  MEIOSIS which  is  shared  with  the  Ameri- cans  by  us.  We  say  a  place  is  some distance  off,  meaning  a  long way;  we say  'It  needs some faith  to  believe that',  meaning  a  hardly possible credulity.  So far the  effect  is  exactly parallel  to the  emphatic use  of  rather in  answer  to a  question—'Do  you like it  ?'  'Rather !', meaning not somewhat, but  exceedingly  (see  RATHER  5). The irregular  development comes  in  when some,  meiosis  and all, is  transferred some from  its  proper region  of  quantity  or number  to  that  of  quality; some faith is  a  wonderful amount  of  faith;  but some war is  a  wonderful kind  or  speci- men of war, and some pumpkins (more than  100  years old, and  said  to be the original  American phrase) were  not a great  number of pumpkins,  but  pump- kins  of  so superior  a  quality  as to be the only fitting description  of the speaker's  girl  friend  (She  was  some pumpkins).

When  we say  that  a person's argument  is s.p., we  mean that  he has  tried  to  convice  us by calling  our  attention  to  whatever makes  for the  conclusion  he  desires, and  diverting  it  from whatever makes against  it. But  this  is, not  indeed  the highest,  but at any  rate  the  almost universal,  argumentative procedure. That  is, it is  advocacy  or (in the un- technical  sense)  pleading,  and the  word special  adds nothing  to the  meaning; why  then  call  it  special?  Pleadings,  in law,  are a  series  of  formal  written statements  by the  parties  to a  suit designed  to  establish clearly, before the case  is  tried, what  is the  issue  or question  to be  decided.  S. p. is adaptation  of the  typical outline  for- mulae  to the  circumstances  of a par- ticular  case.  As one  consequence  of modern  legal  reforms, pleadings  are now very commonly dispensed  with; but formerly  the s. p. had to be  done with  extreme accuracy  if  cases  were not  to be  lost  on  points  of  form  that were  of no  real importance.  S. p. accordingly  became identified  with legal  quibbling,  and  suffered  the  same fate  as  casuistry, passing into  a by- word  for  dishonest evasion  of  real issues.

The  most  that  can be ven- tured  is  that  speciality  is in  most senses the commoner,  and  that  specialty  pre- vails  in the  sense  of a  special subject of  study  or  research  and in the  legal sense  of a  contract under  seal.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

These words, like RESPECTIVE(LY),  though their real value need  not be  questioned,  are  often resorted  to by  those  who  have  no  clear idea  of  their meaning  but  hold  them to diffuse  an air of  educated precision. A short table  of the  senses  of  specific follows,  showing  the  relation  of  each to  the  central notion  of  species;  it is in the last rather loose sense  that  it may be wise  to  avoid  the  word  and  choose one  of the  more generally understood synonyms. 1.

 points,"creates an obligation to declare one's general  attitude  towards reform be- fore touching any details. The line here followed is,  then:  that  the sub- stitution for our present chaos of a phonetically  consistent method  that did not sacrifice the many merits of the old spelling would be of incalculable value;  that  a phonetically consistent method is in  English  peculiarly hard to reconcile  with  the keeping together of  word-families, owing to the havoc played  on syllable sounds by varia- tions of stress;  that  attempts  at so radical  a reform are likely to  meet  in- superable prejudice, and so perhaps to delay  less  ambitious but desirable changes;  that  most reformers are so much more awake to the obvious ad- vantages  of change than to its  less  ob- vious  evils  that  we cannot  trust  them with  the disposal of so vastly important a  matter;  and, finally,  that  English  had better  be treated in the  English  way, and its  spelling  not be revolutionized but amended in detail, here a little and  there  a little as absurdities become intolerable, till a result is attained  that shall  neither overburden schoolboys nor  stultify  intelligence nor outrage the scholar. 'Those who reverence [the uncompromising tyranny of our spell- ing  system]  ',  said Robert  Bridges,  'have to learn  that  it has no divine right, and if  they obstinately uphold its usurpa- tion they are playing into the hands of  the revolutionists, who would cast it off altogether and substitute the worse tyranny of a questionable pho- netic system.' In this book some mod- est  attempts  are  made  at cleaning up the more obtrusive untidinesses; certain inconsistencies  have been regarded as no longer required of us in the present diffusion  of literacy. The well-known type theoretic-radical cum practical- conservative covers perhaps a majority of  our population, and its influence is as  sound and sane in the sphere of spelling  as elsewhere. 2.

 points,"perhaps nine-tenths of  them  would be whether  some  single  consonantal sound was  given by a  single  letter,  as m or t or c, or a double  letter,  as mm or tt, or two or more, as  sc  or cq or sch. Acquiesce  and  aqueduct,  bivouac and bivouacking,  Britain and Brittany, committee  and  comiry,  crystal and chrysalis,  inoculate and innocuous, in- sta//  and  insti/,  harass and embarrass, leveled  and  unparalle/ed,  personify and  personnel,  schedule  and  shed, science  and silence, tic and  tic&,  are examples enough. The use of double letters (tt etc.) or two letters (ck etc.) to  give  a  single  sound  is due some- times to the composition of a word, as  when  in-  not and  nocens  harmful are  combined to make  innocent,  some- times to the convention by which the sound of  a  preceding vowel tends to be of one kind (à ë î ô û) before a  single letter  and of another (a ë ï ô ù) before two, and sometimes to factors in word- formation, perhaps philologically ex- plicable,  but  less  obvious than in compounds like  innocent.  Of these causes  the only one  that  has a meaning for  anyone who knows no language but  English  is the convention of vowel sounds.  He is aware  that  much more often than not a distinction exists analogous  to  that  between  holy  and holly,  but the interference of the other causes  is so incalculable and so fre- quent  that  he  soon  finds it hopeless to rely  upon  the principle in doubtful cases.  Hence a  large  proportion of the tears shed over spelling. Little relief can  be given; the words in which sound is no guide to  whether  a con- sonantal  sound is given by one  letter or two are not a score or so of which a  list could be made and learnt, but thousands. Nothing short of a com- plete  spelling-book will serve the  turn of  a really weak speller, though it is true  that  a short list can be made of words in which mistakes are especially common, and  that  some  classes  of mistake can be guarded against by rules.  Such a list is best made by each person who finds himself in need of it, out of his own experience and to suit his own requirements ;  a  few words that  will usually be included are  abbre- viate,  accommodate, appal, banister, battalion,  bilious, Britannia,  Brittany, bulrush,  bunion, camellia, canonical, committee,  desiccated, disappear, dis- appoint,  embarrass,  exaggerate,  harass, innocuous,  inoculate, install, instil, moccasin,  saddler, skilful, tonsillitis, unparalleled.  It is  worth  remark  that words presenting two opportunities for  mistake like  disappoint  (dissap-, disapp-,  dissapp-,  disap-),  or  three like  unpara//e/ed,  are more than two or  three  times as dangerous as others, temptations to assimilate or  dissimilate the two or more treatments being added to the doubled or trebled oppor- tunity. Among the rules referred to above are  those  that  govern the doubling or not of a word's final consonant when suffixes  are added in inflexion or word- formation. Directions are given for the various consonants under the articles  -B-, -BB-,  and so on, to be found in their alphabetical places ; but it may be useful to state the main prin- ciple here  :—Words  ending in a  single- letter  consonant preceded by a short vowel sound, when they have added to  them  a suffix beginning  with  a vowel (e.g.  -ed  of  the past,  -er  of the agent or of  comparison,  -able  or  -y  of adjec- tives),  double the final  letter  if they either are monosyllables or bear their accent on the last  syllable; they keep it  single  if they have their last syllable unaccented. But a  final 1 is doubled irrespective of accent, and  with  a final s usage  varies. Thus the addition of  -ed  to the verbs pot,  regret,  limit, travel,  and  bias,  gives potted  (monosyllable),  regretted  (ac- cented  final),  limi  te  d  (unaccented  final), travelled  (final 1), and  biassed  or pre- ferably  biased  (final  s); similarly the verbs  tar, demur, simper, level,  focus, give  tarring,  demurring,  simpering, levelling,  and  focussing  or preferably focusing;  the adjectives  thin,  common, cruel,  give  thinnest,  commonest,  and cruellest;  the nouns  gas, syrup  give gassy,  syrupy. Two more questions of  single  and double letters are of importance to",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
spelling points,"weak spellers.  In  forming adverbs  in -ly  from adjectives  in  -1  or  -11,  neither a  single nor  a  tripJe  1  is  ever  right  ;  fully purposeful,  especial,  and  dull,  have  ad- verbs  fully,  purposefully,  especially,  and dully.  And in  forming nouns  in  -ness from adjectives  in -n  both  «s  are re- tained— commonness,  rottenness,  plain- ness,  etc.;  even  solemn,  with  its  mute n,  need hardly  be  excepted,  but the OED  gives  the  orthodox  solemnness only  as a  variant  of  solemness. 3.

The  c ex- ception covers the many derivatives of Latin  capio,  which are in such common use  that  a simple rule of  thumb  is useful  {receive,  deceit, inconceivable; but  relieve,  belief,  irretrievable). The writing of the very common and-  against instead of the rarer  ante- before  (e.g.  antichamber,  antidated)  is to be carefully avoided. Verbs in  -cede,  -ceed,  are so many and so  much  used, and the causes  of  the difference are so far from obvious, that  mistakes are frequent and a list will be helpful:  cede,  accede, antecede, concede,  intercede,  precede,  recede,  rétro- cède,  secede,  to which may be added supersede;  but  exceed,  proceed,  succeed. The curious thing is  that  a division so little reasonable should be so reli- giously  observed;  there  is no disagree- ment  among good spellers, and the only  mistake into which they occa- sionally  slip is  preceeding  for  preceding. Adjectives and nouns in  -ble,  -de, -tie,  etc., make their adverbs and ad- jectives not by adding  -ly  or -y, but by changing  -le to -ly:  humbly, subtly, singly,  supply  (not  supplely), treacly, tangly. Adjectives in  -ale,  -He,  -ole,  add -ly for their adverbs :  stalely, vilely, docile- ly, solely;  but  whole  makes  wholly. For verbs ending in  -bre, -tre,  etc., the forms  sabring, accoutring, centring, mitring,  manoeuvring,  are recommended in preference to  sabreing,  manœuvering, etc. Similarly  ochrous  and  ogrish  seem better  than  ochreous  or  ocherous  and ogreish  or  ogerish;  but impious hands can  hardly be laid  upon  acreage. Of adjectives in  -(e)rous  some never use the e, as  cumbrous, disastrous, idolatrous,  leprous,   lustrous, mon- strous,  wondrous;  some have it always, as  boisterous,  murderous,  obstreperous, slanderous,  thunderous; dextrous  and slumbrous  are  better  than  dexterous  and slumberous. sphere.

That  is undoubtedly so, and the spelling prob- lem presented is an awkward one. On the one hand, the notion of m. and f. forms for adjectives is entirely alien to English,  and if a French adjective is to make itself at home  with  us it must choose  first whether it will go in male or female attire and discard its other garments;  on this point cf.  NAIF  and naive.  On the other hand, the choice with  this particular word is a dilemma; if  we decide for  -el  we are sacrificing the much more familiar of the two forms—more  familiar because the word has been chiefly applied to women and in  this  application pur- posely  made feminine by those who recognize  both  genders.

To the second  class,  those who do not know but do care, who would as soon  be caught putting their knives in their mouths as splitting an infinitive but have only hazy notions of what constitutes  that  deplorable breach of etiquette, this article is chiefly ad- dressed.  These people betray by their practice  that  their aversion to the split infinitive  springs not from instinctive good  taste, but from tame acceptance of  the misinterpreted opinion of others ; for  they will subject their sentences to the queerest distortions, all to escape imaginary  split infinitives. 'To really understand' is a s. i.; 'to really be understood' is a s.  i.;  'to be really understood' is not one ; the havoc  that is  played  with  much well-intentioned writing by failure to grasp  that  distinc- tion is incredible. Those upon whom the fear of infinitive-splitting sits heavy  should remember  that  to  give conclusive  evidence, by distortions, of misconceiving  the nature of the s. i. is  far more damaging to their literary prétentions  than an actual lapse could be  ;  for it exhibits  them  as deaf to the normal rhythm of  English  sentences. No sensitive ear can  fail  to be shocked, if  the following examples are read aloud, by the strangeness of the in- dicated adverbs. Why on earth, the reader wonders, is  that  word out of its place? He will find, on looking through  again,  that  each has been turned out of a similar position, viz. between the word  be  and a passive participle. Reflection will assure him that  the cause of dislocation is always the  same—all  these writers have  sacri- ficed the run of their sentences to the delusion  that  'to be really understood' is  a split infinitive. It is not; and the straitest non-splitter of us all can  with a  clear conscience restore each of the adverbs  to its rightful place: He was proposed at the last moment as a candidate  likely  generally  to be ac- cepted. /  When  the record of this cam- paign  comes  dispassionately  to be  writ- ten, and in just perspective, it will be found  that  . . . / New principles will have  boldly  to be adopted if the Scot- tish case is to be met. / This is a very serious  matter, which clearly ought further  to be inquired into. / The Head- master of a public school possesses very  great powers, which ought  most carefully  and  considerately  to be exer- cised.  / The time to get  this  revaluation put through is when the amount paid by  the State to the localities is  very largely  to be increased. 3.  The above writers are bogy- haunted creatures who for fear of splitting an infinitive abstain from doing  something quite different, i.e. dividing  be  from its complement by an  adverb  ;  see further under  POSITION OF  ADVERBS.  Those who presumably do know what split infinitives are, and condemn them, are not so  easily identified, since they include all who neither commit the sin nor flounder about in  saving  themselves from  it—all who combine a reasonable dexterity with  acceptance of conventional rules. But  when the dexterity is lacking, disaster  follows. It does not add to a writer's readableness if readers are pulled up now and  again  to  wonder— Why this distortion? Ah, to be sure, a  non-split die-hard  !  That is the men- tal dialogue occasioned by each of the adverbs  in the examples below. It is of  no  avail  merely to  fling  oneself desperately out of  temptation;  one must so do it  that  no traces of the struggle  remain. Sentences must if necessary  be  thoroughly  remodelled instead  of having a word lifted from its original  place and dumped elsewhere: What  alternative can be found which the Pope has not condemned, and which will make it possible  to  organize legally  public worship  ?  / It will, when better  understood,  tend  firmly to  estab- lish  relations between Capital and Labour.  / Both Germany and England have  done ill in not combining  to for- bid  flatly  hostilities. / Every effort must be made  to  increase  adequately  profes- sional  knowledge and attainments. / We have had  to  shorten  somewhat  Lord",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 infinitive,"D-   's  letter.  / The kind of sin- cerity which enables an author  to move powerfully  the heart would . . . /  Safe- guards  should be provided  to prevent effectually  cosmopolitan  financiers from manipulating these reserves. 4.  Just as those who know and con- demn the s. i. include many who are not recognizable, since only the clum- sier  performers give positive proof of resistance  to  temptation,  so too those who know and approve are not distin- guishable  with  certainty.  When  a man splits an infinitive, he may be doing it unconsciously as a member of our class  1,  or he may be deliberately rejecting the trammels of convention and announcing  that  he means to do as he will  with  his own infinitives. But, as  the  following  examples are from newspapers of high  repute,  and high newspaper tradition is strong against splitting, it is perhaps fair to assume that  each specimen is a manifesto of in- dependence : It will be found possible to  considerably improve  the present wages  of the miners  without  jeopardiz- ing  the interests of capital. / Always providing  that  the Imperialists do not feel  strong enough  to  decisively  assert their power in the revolted provinces. / But  even so,  he  seems  to still be  allowed to speak at Unionist demonstrations. / It is the intention of the Minister of Transport  to substantially  increase  all present rates by means of a general percentage. / The men in many of the largest  districts are declared  to  strongly favour  a strike if the minimum wage is not conceded. It should be noticed  that  in these the separating adverb could have been placed outside the infinitive  with  little or in most cases no damage to the sentence-rhythm   {considerably  after miners,  decisively  after  power, still  with clear  gain  after  be, substantially  after rates,  and  strongly  at some  loss  after strike),  so  that  protest seems a safe diagnosis. 5.  The  attitude  of those who know and distinguish is something like this: We admit  that  separation of to  from its infinitive is not in itself desirable,  and we shall not gratuit- ously  say either  'to  mortally wound' or 'to mortally be  wounded';  but we are not foolish enough to con- fuse  the latter  with  'to be mortally wounded', which is blameless  English, nor 'to just have heard'  with  'to have just heard', which is  also  blameless. We maintain, however,  that  a real s. i., though not desirable in itself, is prefer- able to either of two things, to real ambiguity, and to  patent  artificiality. For  the first, we will rather  write  'Our object is to further cement trade rela- tions' than, by correcting into 'Our object is further to cement . . .', leave it doubtful  whether  an additional ob- ject or additional cementing is the point.  And for the second, we take it that  such reminders of a tyrannous convention as 'in not combining to forbid flatly hostilities' are far more abnormal than the abnormality they evade.  We will split infinitives sooner than be ambiguous or artificial; more than  that,  we will freely admit  that sufficient recasting will get rid of any s.  i.  without  involving either of those faults,  and yet reserve to ourselves the right of deciding in each case  whether recasting  is  worth  while. Let us take an  example: 'In these circumstances, the Commission, judging from the evidence taken in London, has been feeling  its way to modifications in- tended to  better  equip successful can- didates for careers in India and at the same  time  to  meet  reasonable Indian demands.'  To  better  equip?  We refuse  'better  to equip' as a shouted reminder of the tyranny; we refuse 'to  equip  better'  as ambiguous  {better an  adjective?); we regard 'to equip successful  candidates  better'  as lacking compactness, as possibly tolerable from an anti-splitter, but not good enough for us.  What  then  of recast- ing?  'intended to make successful candidates fitter for' is the best we can do if the exact sense is to be  kept  ; it takes some thought to arrive at the correction; was the game  worth  the candle? After this inconclusive discussion, in which, however, the author's opinion has  perhaps been allowed to appear",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
splodge,"with  indecent plainness, readers may like  to settle the following question for themselves. 'The greatest difficulty about  assessing  the economic achieve- ments of the Soviet Union is  that  its spokesmen try absurdly to exaggerate them;  in consequence the visitor may tend badly to underrate  them.'  Has dread of the s. i. led the writer to attach his  adverbs to the wrong verbs, and would he not have done  better  to boldly  split  both  infinitives, since he cannot put the adverbs after  them without  spoiling his rhythm? Or are we to  give  him the benefit of the  doubt, and suppose  that  he really meant  ab- surdly  to qualify  try  and  badly  to qualify  tend} It is perhaps hardly fair  that  this article should have quoted no split infinitives  except  such  as,  being reason- ably  supposed (as in 4) to be deliberate, are  likely to be favourable specimens.

It is not judiciously  used by a writer who can hardly  be supposed to mean literally any  standards, but does not tell us (perhaps does not even know himself) what standards he does mean; as for instance (to quote Wilson)  'when  a new novel is described as ""of major significance""  or ""a superb achieve- ment""  ""by any standards"",  without one's  knowing whether the standards invoked are supposed to include Tol- stoy  and Flaubert or whether it merely means  that  the reviewer does not happen at the moment to remember that  he has ever read anything  that seemed to excite him more'.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

No harm is done,  starlit  being a blameless word, and indeed  better  in some con- texts  ; if 'a starlight night' and 'a  star- lit sea' have their epithets exchanged, both  suffer to the  extent  at least of sounding  unnatural.

 -hole.,"The earliest OED quotation for the first is dated  1887; the  -hole  form goes back to  1660.  That is  no  doubt  because it was only when steampower was used at sea  that  a word was needed for  that  part  of the hold of a ship in which stoking was done. But the subsequent encroach- ment  of  hold  on  hole  for stoking-places on land suggests  that  hole,  though the true  form, is now  thought  undignified. Though the OED defines the two differently, the impression produced by its quotations is not  that  there  are two names for two different things, but rather  that  stokehole  has had in its time, and perhaps  still  has, more than one meaning. To maintain a distinc- tion  between  words at once so similar in form and, to the general public, so vague  in sense, is clearly impossible.

stops,"in particular are taught,  to show  that  in particular  relates to all four  languages and  not to Spanish only. The sen- tence should be  recast,  and this can easily  be done by moving  in par- ticular  from the tail of the pro- cession  to the lead of it. (Similarly if  the writer wanted to make it quite clear  that  in particular  quali- fied  Spanish  only this could be done by  inserting those words immediately before  Spanish.) Nothing had been allowed  to be published except  books, pamphlets,  and  papers,  which  had  secured the  approval  of the Communist party. Here the comma after  papers  removes any  possibility  that that  word alone may  be taken as the antecedent of which,  but only at the cost of separat- ing  inseparables—the  denning  relative from its antecedent. Here  again  re- construction is  easy,  e.g.  No  books, pamphlets,  or  papers  had been allowed to  be  published  except  those  that had  etc. It is not only enumerations  that tempt  a writer to put a comma be- tween  subject and verb. Any long and involved  subject will do so. He may for  instance feel the  need  of a comma after  subject  in  The  question  whether it is ever legitimate to use a comma to mark  the end of a  long  and  complicated subject  is an  arguable  one.  Even good writers sometimes do this. But it is surely  better  to recast an ungainly sen- tence than to try to mend it by the crude device of an intrusive comma. B.  Within  enumerations. The more usual  way of punctuating such an enumeration as was used as an example in the preceding  section  is French,  German, Italian and Spanish: the commas between  French  and  Ger- man  and  German  and  Italian  take the place  of  ands;  there  is no comma after Italian  because,  with  and,  it would be otiose.  There are, however, some who favour  putting  one there, arguing  that, since  it may sometimes be needed to avoid  ambiguity, it may as well be used always for the sake of uniformity. Examples  of sentences calling for a comma before the  and  are:  Tenders were  submitted by  John  Brown,  Cam- mel  Laird,  Vickers, and Harland and  Wolff.  Without  the comma after Vickers  we do not know  whether  the tendering firms were four or five, or, if  they were four,  whether  Harland partners  Vickers  or  Wolff.  /  The  smooth grey  of the  beech  stem, the silky  texture of  the  birch,  and the  rugged  pine.

SENTENCES.,"EXCLAMATION Not to use a mark of exclamation is sometimes wrong:  How they  laughed., instead of  How they laughed!,  is not English.  Excessive use of exclamation marks  is,  like  that  of  ITALICS,  one of the things  that  betray the uneducated or unpractised writer :  You  surprise  me, How dare  you?,  Don't tell such lies,  are mere statement, question, and com- mand, not converted into exclamations by the fact  that  those who say  them  are excited, nor to be decorated into  You surprise  me!, How dare you!,  Don't  tell such  lies!.  It is, indeed, stated in a well-known grammar  that  'A note of exclamation is used after words or sentences which express emotion', with,  as example,  How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! I am distressed  for  thee,  my  brother  Jonathan!. The second half of this quotation clearly  violates the rule laid down above,  being, however full of emotion, a  simple statement, and yet having an exclamation mark. But anyone who will refer to 2  Sam.  i. 26 will find  that mark to be not the  Bible's,  but the grammarian's;  the earlier one of verse 25  is right. So far, the inference seems obvious and  simple—to  confine the exclamation to  what  grammar recog- nizes  as exclamations, and refuse it to statements, questions, and commands. Exclamations in grammar are  (1)  inter- jections,  as  oh!;  (2) words or phrases used as interjections, as  Heavens!, hell!,  by  Jove!,   my  God!, Golly!; (3)  sentences containing the exclama- tory  what  or  how,  as  What  a  difference it makes!,  What  I suffered!, How  I  love you!,  How pretty she is!;  (4) wishes proper, as  Confound  you!, May we live to  see it!, God forbid! ;  (5) Ellipses and inversions  due to emotion, as  Not another  word!, If only I could!,  That  it should  have  come  to this!, Much  care you!,  Pop  goes  the weasel!,  A  fine  friend you have been!;  (6) apostrophes, as You  miserable  coward!, You little dear!. It is  true  that  the exclamation mark should be given to all expressions answering  to the above types, and  also that  it should not be given to ordinary fully  expressed statements, questions, or commands; but the  matter  is not quite so simple as  that.  Though a sentence is not to be exclamation- marked to show  that  it has the excited tone  that  its contents imply, it may and sometimes must be so marked to convey  that  the tone is not merely what  would be natural to the words themselves, but is  that  suitable to scornful quotation, to the unexpected, the amusing, the disgusting, or  other- wise to imply  that  the words, if spoken, would have a special intonation. So: You thought it  didn't  matter!, He learnt  at last that the enemy  was — him- self!, Each is as bad as the other, only more  so!, He puts his knife in his mouth!. But  not:  That  is a lie!, My heart was in my mouth!, Who  cares!,  I wish you would  be quiet!,  Beggars  must not be choosers!;  in all these the words  them- selves  suffice to show the tone, and the exclamation mark shows only  that the writer does not know his business. QUESTION MARK The chief danger is  that  of forgetting that  whether  a set of words is a ques- tion or not, and consequently requires or repudiates the question mark, is decided not by its practical effect or sense,  but by its grammatical form and relations.  Those who scorn grammar are apt to take  Ask him who said so  for a  question, and  Will  you please  stajîd back  for a request, and to wrongly give the first the question mark  that  they wrongly  fail  to give the second.  But  the first  is in fact a command containing an  INDIRECT  QUESTION,  and the  ques- tion mark belongs to direct questions only,  while the second is in fact a direct question, though it happens to be equivalent in sense to a request.

Where,  as in the  third  and  fifth examples, strict  logic  would require two symbols,  one  each side  of the inverted comma,  logic  must respect appearances and  be  content  with  one, as  it has to  with  full stops when  a quotation and  the  sentence containing it  end  together.

A piano is a  stringed instrument, but if the strings need renewing it will be  restrung.  See  HAM- STRINGED  for discussion of  that  word and of  bowstring,  v. strive.

It is well, however, to realize  that  there  are such things as foolish  idioms ; an abundance of  them in  a  language can be no credit  to  it or its users, and drawing attention to  them  may help to keep down their numbers.

We  may  accordingly divide  the  uses of  the  subjunctive into four  classes, which  we  will  call  Alives, Revivals, Survivals,  and  Arrivals,  and no con- cealment need  be  made  of the  purpose in  hand, which  is to  discourage  the last  two  classes. ALIVES,  i.e.  uses  that  are  still  our natural form  of  speech. Those uses  are  alive which  it  occurs to  no one to  suspect  of  pedantry  or artificiality,  and  which come  as  natural in  speech  as  other ways  of  saying  the thing,  or  more so. Specimens  are: Go away  (and all 2nd-person impera- tives). Manners  be  hanged!  (and  such  3rd- person imprecations).

REVIVALS,  i.e. antiquated uses re- vived  for poetic effect or some other special  purpose. What  care  I how fair she be? Lose  who may, I still can say . . . If  ladies  be but young and fair. But  illustration is  superfluous;  there are no uses of the subjunctive to which poets, and poetic writers, may not  re- sort if it suits  them.  The  point  to be made is merely  that  it is no defence for the ordinary writer who uses an anti- quated subjunctive to plead  that  he can  parallel it in a good  poet. SURVIVALS,  i.e. uses formerly natural but now falling into disuse. In the examples  that  will be given there  is nothing incorrect. The objec- tion to the subjunctives in  them  is  that they are used in constructions where the indicative is now so much more usual  that  they diffuse an atmosphere of  formalism over the writing in which they occur; the motive under- lying  them,  and the effect they pro- duce, are the same  that  attend the choosing  of  FORMAL  WORDS,  a  refer- ence to which article may save some repetition. If  it have  [has]  a flaw, that flaw takes the  shape of a slight  incoherence.  /  It is quite  obvious to what  grave  results such instances  as the above may lead, be they [if  they are]  only  sufficiently  numerous.  / //  Mr.  Hobhouse's  analysis of the vices of  popular government be  [is]  correct, much  more  would seem to be needed.  / It  were  [would be]  futile to attempt to deprive  it of its real meaning.  /  Do not ring  unless an answer be  [is]  required.  / That  will  depend  a  good  deal on  whether he  be  [is]  shocked by the cynicism.  / Whether these tales be  [are]  true or exaggerated  it is certain that few of  his successors  could  perform  any such re- markable  feats. ARRIVALS,  i.e. incorrect uses due to growing unfamiliarity  with  the idio- matic uses of the mood. The best proof  that  the subjunctive is, except  in isolated uses, no longer alive, and one good reason for abstaining from it even where, as in the  Survival examples, it is permissible, are pro- vided by a collection, such as anyone can  gather for himself from any news- paper,  of  subjunctives  that  are wrong. A collection follows, roughly grouped. MIXED MOODS  :  That  two verbs whose relation to their surroundings is pre- cisely  the same should be one sub- junctive and one indicative is an ab- surdity  that  was unlikely to happen until the distinction had lost its reality; but now it happens every day : //  that appeal  be made and results  in the  return of  the Government to power, then . .  . / There  are  those  who, if  there  be  common security  and they  are  all right, not only care  nothing  for, but would even  oppose, the  . . .  I  If the verdict  goes  against him his home may be  sold  up, or if an  injunc- tion  be obtained  against him and he defies  it he may be  imprisoned.  / These bes  are not themselves wrong; they are Survival subjunctives; but the fact that  the verbs associated  with  them, which have subjunctives ready for use just as much as  to be,  are allowed to remain indicative shows  that  the use of  be  is mechanical and meaningless. WERE IN CONDITIONALS: The  correct type, a common enough  'Survival',  is Were  that true  there  were  no  more  to say.  The first  were,  of the protasis, is right only in combination  with  the other  were,  of the apodosis, or  with its modern equivalent,  would be.

subjunctives,"time  at all (and  especially  not to a particular past time)  but to  Utopia,  the realm of  non-fact.  If it  is  a  hard  saying that  were  (singular)  in  conditionals does  not  refer  to  past time, consider some other verb  of  past form  in  like case.  Such  a  verb may  belong  to  past time,  or it  may belong  to  Utopia :  If  he heard,  he gave no sign (heard  and  gave, past time)  ; //  he heard, how angry  he would  be! (heard  and  would be,  not  past time,  but  Utopia,  the  realm  of non- fact  or  the  imaginary)  ; the  first  heard  is indicative,  the  second  is  subjunctive, though  the  form happens  to be the same.  In the  verb  be,  conveniently enough,  there  happens  to be  still  a distinguishable  form  for the  subjunc- tive,  and if  that  verb were used  in sentences similar  in  form  to the two sentences containing  heard  they would be  //  it  was  (never  were)  so  it  did not ap- pear,  If it  were  (or  nowadays alterna- tively  was) so how angry we should be! Were  (sing.)  is,  then,  a  recognizable subjunctive, and applicable  not to  past facts,  but to  present  or  future  non- facts  ;  it is  entirely  out of  place  in an i/-clause  concerned  with  past actuali- ties  and not  answered  by a  were  or would  be  in the  apodosis. It  has  been necessary  to  labour this explanation because  for the many readers  who are not at  home with  grammatical technicalities  the matter  is  puzzling. Examples:  It is stated  that, during the early part  of  the War  of  Independence  (1821),  the Greeks massacred  Mussulmans;  if  this  were  50, it was only  in  self-defence.  /  If  rent were  cheap, clothes  were  dearer than today.

The  newspaper  is patting  the  Prince  on the  back  for what  he  actually  did, viz.  stoke;  it means  not  that  it  would  be  right  on an imaginary  occasion,  but  that  it  was  on that  past occasion right  for him to stoke  ;  read  was.  /  The dull winter  pros- pect  appeared  so  quiet and peaceful,  it were difficult  to  imagine  the  Boches over  there — on  sentry,  in  their dugouts, eating,  drinking,  sleeping,  just like  the men about me.  Paraphrasing  so as to get  rid of the  glamour  of the  word were,  we get not 'I  should find  it difficult',  but 'I  found  it  difficult'; read  it  was difficult. SEQUENCE:  TO those  who  have  had to  do  with  Latin and Greek Grammar, there  will  be a  familiar sound  in  Se- quence  of  tenses  and  Sequence  of  moods  ; what  is  implied  in the  terms  is  that  it may  be  necessary  to use a  tense  or a mood  not to  convey  the  meaning pecu- liar  to it as  such,  but for the  sake  of harmony  with  the  tense  or  mood  of another verb  on  which  it  depends. The principle  has  its  place, though little is heard  of  it,  in  English grammar also  (see  SEQUENCE  OF  TENSES);  it is mentioned here because the most likely explanation  of the  subjunctives  now to  be  quoted, some clearly wrong, some  at the  best uncalled-for, seems to  be a  hazy memory  of  sequence  of moods. After each example  the pos- sible  false reasoning  is  suggested :  But if,  during  the  intercourse  occasioned  by trade,  he  finds that  a  neighbour  in  pos- session  of  desirable  property  be  weaker than himself (if he finds  is a  conditional; therefore  the  clause dependent  on it must  be in the  subjunctive).  /  By all means  let us  follow after  those  things which make  for  peace,  so  far as  be  pos- sible  (let us  follow  is an  exhortation; therefore  the  clause dependent  on it must etc.).  /  We  should  be  glad to know that every  chairman  of  a  Local  Education Authority or Education  Committee  were likely to read this  short  biography  (should is  subjunctive, therefore  etc.; or,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

(would  is a subjunctive, therefore etc.). /  If  I  made a  political  pronouncement  I should  feel that I  were  outraging  the hospitality of the  Brotherhood  movement (should  is a subjunctive, therefore etc.). It may be admitted  that  some of these are  less bad than others, and  that,  wliile  the group is characteristic of a time  that is  not at ease  with  its subjunctives, anyone  who wished to parallel its details  in earlier writers who used the mood far more frequently than we, as well as more naturally, could doubtless do so; nevertheless they are best classed  with  Arrivals. INDIRECT  QUESTION  :  Latin  grammar  is perhaps  also  responsible for the notion that  indirect question requires the sub- junctive. There is no such require- ment  in  English;  Ask him who he be  is enough to show  that.  Sir A. N. asked Sir  R. R. if he  were  aware that one of the  miners'  secretaries  in Scotland had been  .  . . Read  was;  but  again  such subjunctives may be found in older writers. MISCELLANEOUS:  He  therefore  came round  to the view that simple Bible teaching  were  better  abolished  altogether and that the  open  door  for all  religions were  established  in its  place.  Were better abolished  is a correct Survival; but indulging  in a phraseology  that  is now unnatural  has  tempted   the writer into an impossible continua- tion. / Be  the ventilation of a  gaseous mine as efficient as it can be  made, nothing  will  prevent  . .  .

The conclusion is  that  writers who deal  in Survival subjunctives run the risks,  first, of making their  matter needlessly  formal, second, of being tempted  into blunders themselves, third,  of  injuring the language by encouraging  others more ignorant than themselves to blunder habitually, and lastly, of having  the  proper dignity of  style at which they aim mistaken by captious readers for pretentiousness.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

" v., substitution.","A very rapid  change—according  to the view here taken, a  corruption—has  been taking place in the meaning and use of  these words; so rapid, indeed, that  what  the OED stigmatized in 1915  as  'Now  regarded as  incorrect' may,  if nothing can be done to stop it, become normal usage and oust what  is here held to be the words' only true  sense. The definition to which the OED adds the above note is still recorded by the  1964  COD,  with  the comment  'vulg.'  It is (for the verb) 'To take the place of, replace'. The  true meaning is something entirely differ- ent, viz. to put (a person or thing) in the place of another, and the use of the noun follows it. We can set down for comparison a sentence or two  that  are right and one or two  that  are wrong, choosing  as nouns  that  will make the points clear  butter  and  margarine, Englishman  and  alien. CORRECT A. We had to substitute margarine (for butter). B.  Aliens are being substituted (for Englishmen). C. [Aliens are replacing  English- men.] D. The substitution of margarine (for  butter)  is having bad effects. E.  Let  there  be no more substitution of  aliens (for Englishmen). F.  Its substitution (for  butter)  is lamentable. INCORRECT A. We had to substitute  butter  (by margarine). B.  Englishmen are being substituted (by  aliens). C. Aliens are substituting  English- men. D. The substitution of  butter  (by margarine)  is having bad effects. E.  Let  there  be no more substitution of  Englishmen (by  aliens). F.  Its substitution (by margarine) is lamentable. One can hardly read those parallels, with  the risks of ambiguity  that  they suggest,  without  realizing  that  either the old or the new must go. We surely cannot keep such a treacherously double-edged knife  as  substitute  has become; either its original edge or the one into which its back has  been  con- verted must be ground off;  which  is it to be? Another reflection, which may  not occur unsuggested to all, is that  in the incorrect set the words  re- place  or  replacement  would have done, whereas in the correct set to use  them instead of the  sub-  words would either have been impossible or have changed  the meaning. And here, prob- ably,  is  what  accounts for the whole perversion of our words;  substitute and  substitution  have been seized  upon by people who failed to apprehend with  precision the  true  meaning and fancied  they had found equivalents in sense  for the words   replacement), which they had been ignorantly taught to regard as solecisms in the required senses  (see  REPLACE);  SO they deter- mined (in their  lingo)  to substitute replace  by  substitute,  whereas they ought to have refused (in  English)  to substitute  substitute  for  replace  or to replace  replace  by  substitute.

subtopia,"is a puzzling  word.  Clearly it is a  HYBRID,  compounded  of Latin and  Greek  elements, but it does not bear its meaning on its face, even for those  who  know  those  languages. At first sight it seems to be a  compound of  sub  (under)  with  TWO?  (place), and so  should mean  somewhere  under- ground. But the  contexts  it is used in show  that that  cannot  be right. May it  then  be a  compound  of  sub  with  an aphetic  form of  Utopia,  meaning  a place  that  just falls  short  of being ideal?  That  cannot  be right  either; the  word  is certainly not a  term  of praise. Only by tracing the  word  to its source can the  truth  be  found.

 a,"writer's entire ignorance of idiom or to his  finding himself in a difficulty and not seeing how to get out of it. In the following  extracts, when a mere change of  which  etc. to  as  is not possible, a  way out is suggested:  The third year should be  reserved  for   such additional or special subjects  (elocu- tion,  for  instance)  which  need  not be regarded  as essential.  /  It was  proposed to  grant to  such casual employees of the Council who  had been continu- ously  employed for  three  months, and whose employment  was likely to extend over  twelve months, the  privilege  of addi- tional  leave  (read  those,  or  any,  for such).  I  It is subject, of  course,  to  such possible  changes of plan  that  any un- expected  turn of events may  bring  about (read  the  or  those  for  such).  / /  noticed two  cars  approaching  in  such a manner that  seemed  to indicate they would both arrive  at the junction  together  (omit such)  I  There was an item  'Hit  Euro- peans  or cut throat' but  there  was also an item that if a  person  is  arrested  be- cause  of  Congress  the  case  must be taken to  'senior  Europeans' ,  zvhich  presumably means the High Court or  such of  them whose  throats had not been cut  (read as  had not had their throats cut). 2.  Such that  rel. and  such that  conj. Now and  then  a  s. that  for  s. as  is perhaps due to the writer's hesitating between two ways of  putting  a thing, one  with  the relative  as  and the other with  the conjunction  that,  and finally achieving  neither, but stumbling in- to the relative  that.

The Earl of Derby was the titular King of  Man — a  piece  of constitutional anti- quarianism of which  Scott  made  such splendid use  in  'Peveril  of the Peak'. Such  is liable to the same over-use of this kind as  so;  reference to so 3 will make  further  illustration unnecessary here. Use and over-use of an idiom are different things, and  there  is no need to avoid this  such  altogether. In the above quotation it may be noticed that  if the  writer  had said  the  piece of antiquarianism instead of  a  piece the such  would have passed well enough. 4.  The illiterate  such  (used instead of those,  it, them  or  other  pronoun). The significance  of the  epithet  will  be found explained  in  ILLITERACIES,  and a few examples  with  corrections will suffice : His seven  propositions  for non-partisan legislation  must appeal to the common- sense  of every man and woman in the realm;  is it too much to  hope  that  such will  combine to render them realities? (that  all will). /  We have seen  during  the war how  those  persons  in humble circum- stances  who came suddenly into  posses- sion  of  moneys  spent  such— i.e.,  in . .  . (spent  them). /  But when it  comes  to us following  his life and example, in all its intricate  details, all will, I think,  agree that  such is  impossible  (that  that  is). / An appeal to philanthropy is hardly necessary,  the grounds  for such being S3  self-evident  (for it being). 5.  The  defining  such.  A useful device in drafting legal documents, where precision is all-important, is to use such  in the sense of as defined above, so as  to avoid ambiguity  without  having to repeat the defining words, as in  The particulars  required  by this section may be  furnished by or on behalf of any per- son  who is a party to the  agreement.  .  . and where such particulars are  duly furnished  by  or  on  behalf  of any such person  the  provisions  of this  section  shall be  deemed to be  duly  complied with on the part of all  such  persons.  Sometimes this device may be legitimate for the ordinary  writer,  but more often his such  is  merely  a starchy  substitute  for that  or for using a pronoun instead of repeating the word  that  such  qualifies, as  it is in the following examples :  That there  is a void in a millionaire's life is not  disproved  by anyone  showing  that a number of  millionaires  do not  recognize such void (recognize it,  or  the  or  that void.)  I  If I am refused the  Sacrament I  do not believe that I shall have  less chance  of  entering  the Kingdom of  God than  if I  received such Sacrament (re- ceived it). 6.  Such — so.  Most people have no hesitation in saying  such  a small  matter, such  big apples, with such little justice, such  conflicting  evidence;  others object and say  that  it should be  so  small  a matter,  apples  so big,  with  so  little  justice, evidence  so conflicting.  It  must  first be admitted  that  (with  allowances for phrases of special meaning) the objec- tors are entitled to claim the  support  of grammar. In 'such a small  matter*  it is usually  small,  not  matter  or  small mat- ter,  that  is to be modified by  such  or so,  and,  small  being an adjective, the adverb  so  is obviously the grammatical word to do the job. (At the same time, such  a small matter,  though it usually means so small a  matter,  may also mean a small  matter  of the kind  that has  been described; but, speaking generally,  the objectors have grammar on  their  side.) Shall we  then  be meek and mend our ways at  their  bidding? Why no, not wholesale. We will try to say  50  wherever idiom does not pro- test  or stiffness ensue. For instance, we will give up  'with  such little jus- tice'  without  a  murmur;  but they can- not  expect  of us 'I never saw apples so  big' instead of 'such big apples'. And they  must  please to remark  that the  such  idiom has so established itself that  the  other  is often impossible  with- out a change of order  that  suggests formality or rhetoric;  so big  apples}  so conflicting  evidence?  No; the adjective has  to be deferred  (apples so big)  in a clearly  artificial way; but we grant  that 'so  small a  matter'  does strictly deserve preference over  'such  a small  matter', and, if so partial a concession is  worth",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

But  the  essential significance  of the French suffixes  et  and  ette  is diminutive  (clarionet  =  a  little clarion, cigarette  = a  little  cigar);  and many of the militant suffragettes were  by no means diminutive.  We  use  the  suffix in  its  proper  sense  in  such words  as leaderette,  and,  by a not  unreasonable extension,  to  imply  not a  diminutive but  a  synthetic quality,  e.g.  flannelette, leatherette.  The  belief engendered  by suffragette  that  ette  is a  feminine  ter- mination is  true  only  to  the  extent  that -ette,  and not  -et,  is the natural diminu- tive  of  French words  of the  feminine gender.

Sulphur- eous  and sulphurous  (sù'l-),  which re- main, have never been effectively differentiated, and the OED refers the reader for most senses of one to defini- tions given under the  other.  Differ- entiation may be expected to come, and perhaps the likeliest course for it to take and therefore the best to  fall  in with  is  that  sulphurous,  now the more popular word, should take to itself the secondary or extended senses, and sulphureous  be restricted to the primary material ones meaning 'of or contain- ing  sulphur'  without  the specific limita- tions  of  sulphuric  and  sulphurous  (-Ur'Us).

The use of  them needs  to be  mended,  but not  ended, and they are dealt  with  elsewhere.

That  ungrammatical piece of nonsense was  written  by the editor of a  scientific periodical to a  contributor who had found his English polished up for him in  proof,  and protested. Both parties being men of determina- tion, the article got no  further  than proof.  It is wrong to start a sentence with  'but' ! It is wrong to start a sen- tence  with  'and' ! It is wrong to end a  sentence  with  a preposition! It is wrong to split an infinitive! See the article  FETISHES  for these and  other such rules of  thumb  and for references to articles in which it is shown how misleading  their sweet simplicity is; see  also the article  SUBSTITUTE  for an illustration of the havoc  that  is wrought by unintelligent applications of an un- intelligent dogma. The best known of  such prohibitions is  that  of the SPLIT  INFINITIVE,  and the  hold  of  that upon  the journalistic mind is well shown in the following, which may be matched almost daily. The  writer  is reporting a  theatre  decree for hat- removal: '.. . the Management relies on the cooperation of the public to strictly enforce this rule'.  Even a  split infinitive  (he comments)  may be  for- given  in so well-intentioned  a  notice. Theatre-managers are not stylists; the split this manager has  perpetrated,  is it not a little one? and to put him, irrelevantly, in the pillory for it betrays the journalist's obsession. Well, beginners may sometimes find that  it is as  much  as their jobs are worth  to resist their editors' edicts, as the champion of 'But' did. On the other  hand, to let oneself be so far possessed  by blindly accepted con- ventions as to take a hand in enforcing",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

supple.,"The fine mass of the heady solidly  yet  supplely  modelled,  is set in a particularly  beautiful convention of the hair.  The adverb is  supply,  not  sup- plely;  cf.  SUBTLE.  It is  true  that  the OED found more instances in  print of  -plely  than of  -ply,  and there- fore on its historical principles made supplely  the standard form. But the pronunciation is undoubtedly  sù'plï, not  sù'pùl-lt,  and the long spelling has been due to the wish to distinguish it to the eye from  supply  (suplV)  n. and v. Such devices are not legitimate  except in  the  last necessity, as  with  singeing and  singing;  and it is to be observed that,  whereas the -e- in  singeing  selects the right of two possible pronuncia- tions, the -le- in  supplely  suggests a wrong one. It is unfortunate  that  ad- jectives in  -bble,  -ckle,  -ddle,  -ffle, -ggle,  -pple,  -ttle  are few and not pro- vided  with  adverbs common enough to settle the question;  subtly  is in fact the best analogue, and its spelling, though  subtlely  has been occasionally used, is now established.

It is often as- sumed  that  the first form is no more than an ignorant and wrong variant of the  other.  Ignorant it often is, no doubt,  the user not  knowing  how to spell  or pronounce  supposititious;  but there  is no reason to call it wrong. Suppositious  and  supposititious  may as well coexist, if  there  is work for two words, as  FACTIOUS  and  factitious;  and, if  the  support  of analogy for the shorter form is demanded,  there  are ambitious,  expeditious, seditious, nutri- tious,  cautious,  and  oblivious  to supply it. There are moreover two fairly distinct senses to be shared, viz. spurious, and hypothetical.  Suppositi- tious  is directly from the Latin p.p. suppositus  =  substituted  or put  in another's place, and therefore has properly the meanings foisted, counter- feit, spurious,  pretended,  ostensible.

These lapses are difficult to  classify  and to exemplify, and any exposition of their nature naturally incurs the charge of PE- DANTRY.

Exam- ples  of zeugma are :  Kill  the boys and the  luggage!  /  With  weeping  eyes and hearts.  /  See Pan with flocks ,  with  fruits Pomona  crowned. What  is common to  both  figures is  that a  single  word  (that  in roman type in each  example) seems to be in the same relation to two others but in fact is not. The distinction between the two figures  is  that  syllepsis  is grammatically correct, but requires  the  single  word to be understood in a different sense with  each of its pair (e.g., in the last with  expresses first accompaniment, but secondly instrument), whereas in zeugma  the  single  word actually  fails to  give  sense  with  one of its pair, and from it the appropriate word has to be supplied— destroy  or  plunder  the lug- gage,  bleeding  hearts, Pan  surrounded.

"tactile, tactual.","Why two  words? And,  there  being two, is any useful differentiation either established or possible?  The existence of  tactile  is sufficiently  explained by the desire for a  form corresponding to a large  class  of adjectives  that  mean having the power or quality of doing or suffering some action—contractile,  ductile, erectile, fictile,  fissile,  flexile,  pensile,  prehen- sile,  protrusile, retractile,  sessile,  and tensile, not to mention more familiar words such as  agile,  docile,  fragile, textile  and volatile. And the exis- tence of  tactual  is sufficiently ex- plained  by  a natural  preference for   tactually  over   tactilely.   The -ual  words belong to Latin abstract nouns in  -us,  and the  -He  words to Latin  verbs, and on the whole their meanings  are  true  to  that  difference, however little we may know or remem- ber it. But,  tactile  and  tactual  (unlike other  pairs such as  agile  and  actual, textile  and  textual)  are used almost in- discriminately,  with  a tendency for -He  to prevail for all purposes, especi- ally  now  that  tactile values  is estab-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 genius.,"Henry  Bradley,  in the OED, sums up the familiar con- trast thus: 'It was by the German writers of the  18th  c.  that  the distinc- tion between ""genius"" and ""talent"", which had some foundation in  French usage,  was sharpened into the strong antithesis which is now universally current, so  that  the one  term  is hardly ever  denned  without  reference to the other. The difference between  genius and  talent  has been formulated very variously  by different writers, but  there is  general agreement in regarding the former as the higher of the two, as  ""creative"" and ""original"", and as achieving  its results by instinctive perception and spontaneous activity, rather than by processes which admit of  being distinctly analysed.' Carlyle's definition of  genius  as meaning 'trans- cendent capacity of taking trouble, first of  all'  provoked from Samuel Butler the comment  that  'it might be more fitly  described as a supreme capacity for  getting its possessors into trouble of  all kinds and keeping  them  therein so  long as the genius  remains*.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Another form of  t.  is  that  dealt with  in  PLEONASM  2, in which  syno- nyms,  either capable of serving the purpose by itself, are conjoined, as in save  and except.  Again, the word is sometimes applied to identical proposi- tions such as  'I  don't like my tea too hot', or  'There  is no need for undue alarm';  for such statements see the truism  section of  COMMONPLACE. 2.  Another  form  is the addition of what have been called  'abstract  appendages' to words  that  have no need of  them, such as  weather  conditions  for  weather, temperature  values  for  temperatures, height  levels  for  heights.  Sometimes these appendages are merely otiose; sometimes  they  are misused  by people who do not know  that  when properly used they  give  the com- pound  a meaning different  from that  of the  single  word, as when an  amateur psychologist,  wanting  to show off, refers to someone's  behaviour pattern  when he means no more than behaviour.

It is  true  that  words are cheap, and, if the cost of  them  as such to the writer were the end of the mat- ter, it would not be  worth  considering.

 duty,"and some  synonyms— cess, contribution,  customs,  due,  excise,  impost, levy,  rate,  toll, tribute.  With  such sets of  words it is often convenient to have a  conspectus of the distinctions and be saved the labour of turning  them up for comparison in separate dic- tionary articles. Such convenience is all  that  is here aimed at, a rough definition of each word being given after some general remarks on the words  tax  and  duty. Historically  a  tax  was a direct charge on a taxpayer which bore some rela- tion to his ability to pay and was im- posed for revenue only; a  duty  was an  indirect charge, levied on transac- tions or commodities and sometimes imposed primarily for political or economic reasons. But  there  is no longer  any clear distinction between the two in Britain. Few taxes are so called  specifically; the most notable are  income  rax  (including  surtax),  profits tax  Sindpurchase  tax.  The rest are most- ly  duties,  e.g.  customs,  excise,  estate, stamp  and the various  licence  duties. Some,  though their statutory designa- tion may be  duty  (e.g.  entertainments, petrol),  are often popularly referred to as  tax.  What  •  vere virtually the same taxes were  officially  called  Excess Profits  Duty  in the first world war and Excess  Profits  Tax  in the second, and later  Excess  Profits  Levy.  As a  generic term  tax  is the widest, embracing not only the imposts specifically called  duties,  but  also,  in the phrase local  taxation,  the  rates  imposed by local  authorities. At the same time duties  as a generic  term  is sometimes used to include those specifically called taxes  : the statutory expression  Inland Revenue  Duties  includes income tax as  well as stamp duty and estate duty. The tangle is past unravelling. Cess,  another word for local taxation, obsolete in England but still current in Scotland  and Ireland. Contribution  was the word originally used  for the  Profits  Tax  (first called National Defence Contribution)  im- posed during the second world war, and for the single-year tax on capital (Special  Contribution)  exacted after it. The word was no  doubt  chosen as a euphemism (cf. the old  benevolence)  in the hope  that  payment of it might be thought of as a privilege rather than an obligation;  even when the  National Defence  Contribution  was rechristened Profits  Tax  by  statute  after the war, Parliament considerately added a pro- viso  that  it would not be unlawful to continue to refer to the tax by its old name. Customs,  payment levied upon im- ports from foreign countries. Due,  any obligatory payment, the nature being usually specified by an attributive noun, as  harbour, market, dues.

In  You treat  her  worse  than I treat her, t.  is a  strong or subordinating conjunc- tion, attaching an adverbial clause to its owner  worse.

than,"conjunction linking the two similarly constructed nouns  you  and /. In  You treat  her  worse  than me,  the same two names  for  t.  are possible, but the ellip- sis  is  of  you treat,  and, in the alterna- tive, the linked nouns are  her  and  me; those are the possibilities if the sen- tence is  said  with  the only sense  that an  educated person  gives  it. But an uneducated person may mean by it You treat her worse than I treat her; and, if it is to be so taken,  t .  is not a conjunction of either kind, but a prepo- sition  governing  me.  Doubts whether a  word is a preposition or a conjunc- tion or  both  are not unknown; see, for  example, BUT  I  with  regard to such phrases as  all but he  (conj.) and  all but him  (prep.);   usage, moreover, changes in such matters with  time. It is obvious, however,  that recognition  of  t .  as a preposition makes some sentences ambiguous  that  could otherwise have only one meaning (/ would  rather you  shot  the  poor  dog than me),  and is to  that  extent  undesirable. The OED statement on the preposi- tion use is  that,  with  the  special excep- tion of  t. whom,  which is  preferred  to t. who  unless  both  can be avoided, 'it is now considered incorrect'. That so- called  incorrectness occurs in the fol- lowing  examples, where, by the strict application  of  the OED ruling,  us, him,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
and,"them  should be  we, he,  and  they. But  the prepositional use of  than  is now so  common colloquially  {He is older than me; they travelled  much  faster than us)  that  the bare subjective pronoun in  such a position strikes the reader as pedantic, and it is  better  either to  give it a more natural appearance by sup- plying  it  with  a verb or to dodge the difficulty  by riot using an inflective pronoun at all. Examples:  He  could do  worse  than  consider  why West Ger- many can put up  210,000  more  houses a  year than us  (than we can). /  The butcher  of the last few months has been a  good  deal  more  obliging  than him  of the  war  period  (than the one). /  Do not let  us split up our  energy  by having  more than one  society;  the idea is  more  than them  all (than all of them). On the other hand, the subjective  hes that  follow had  better  have been  him  on the weak-conjunction principle, espe- cially  since the ellipsis required for the strong-conjunction explanation is awk- ward in the first two : //  ever Captain O'Connor  gives  us a  second  volume, we beg  him to  engage  no  other  artist  than he  who illustrated the first.  /  The Entente had no  better  friend  than he  on  the  other side  of the Atlantic.  /  'I've  foiled  better men  than he'  the Count answered. 7.  Double standard of comparison; more  and  more  t.  A ludicrous example of  conflicting  thans,  which almost any reader would detect, is: 'I have  less confidence  than  Mr. Orr in the valuers being  obliged to adopt his method of valuation  than  that  we all  shall  be com- pelled to adopt theirs'.  Less  is clearly unequal to its two jobs; it can put Mr. Orr in his place  with  regard to me, or the valuers  with  regard to us, but not both.  Such a freak sentence would not be  worth  quoting but for the light it throws on a  less  flagrant but more fre- quent absurdity of the same kind, the following  of  more  and  more  with  than  : My eyes are  more  and  more  averse  to light  than  ever.  /  The  order  has  gradually found  more  and  more  room  for educa- tional  and  learned  work  than was possible  in the early  centuries.  Both sentences would be right if  and  more were omitted; but the introduction of it implies the tacit introduction of other thans  which conflict  with  those  that  are expressed.  More  and  more  means more yesterday  than the day before, and more today than yesterday; to com- bine  that  shifting date  with  the un- shifting  dates  ever  and  in early  centuries is  impossible.  T.  should never be used after  more  and  more. 8.  T.  after non-comparatives.  Else, other,  and their compounds, are the only  words outside  true  comparatives whose right to be followed by  t.  is unquestioned; and  'true  comparatives' is  to be taken as excluding such Latin words as  superior  and  inferior,  senior and  junior,  all of which, as well as  pre- ferable),  require not  t.,  but  to.  The use  of  t.,  on the  analogy  of  other  t., after  different,  diverse,  opposite,  etc., is 'now mostly avoided' (OED). Some",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The adjectival use  (He has  that confidence  in his  theory  that he would act  on it  tomorrow)  was formerly normal English,  and survives colloquially, but in  literary use  such a, so  great  a,  etc., are  substituted. The adverbial use ('to  that  extent  or degree, so much, so, esp.  with  an adv. or adj. of quantity, that  far, that much, that high')  was  said by  the SOED to be dialect and U.S. That would now be too round a state- ment.

The type meant is shown in  that part  affected,  that  land  lying  fallow,  that theory  now in question,  and the con- tention is  that  it is a bad type. In the OED there is a solitary example, and that  justifiable for special reasons; but in modern newspaper use it is very  common. Four specimens are: It was essential that both  these  phases of  his art should be adequately  repre- sented  in  that  branch of the National Gallery  devoted  to native talent.  / That part  relating  to the  freedom  of the seas was given  fairly  fully in the  *  Times'.  / Aphorisms  and maxims are  treated  with that  respect usually reserved  for  reli- gious  dogma.

The use of  that  (demonstrative ad- jective)  with  the sole function of point- ing  forward to a defining relative clause is  established  English,  and  'that  part which concerns us' is as common as 'the  part  that  concerns  us'  ; but when a  participle or phrase is substituted for the relative clause it is an innovation to keep the  that;  it may  safely  be  said that  most good writers take the trouble to clear away the now needless  that, and  write  the  instead.

In adjectival or relative clauses that  begin  with  t.  it is a relative pro- noun, not a conjunction; see for these the  next  article.  T.  conj.  attaches a substantival clause to the verb, noun, etc., to which it is object (/  hear that he is dead),  subject  (T. pain exists is cer- tain),  in apposition (  The fact t. pain exists),  etc. ; or else an adverbial clause to the word etc. modified (  The heat is such  that  it  will  boil  water).  The only point needing to be insisted on is  that in  either  case,  whether the  t .-clause  is substantival or adverbial, the sentence out of which it is made by prefixing t.  must be in statement form, not a  question, command, or exclamation. Sentences  of those other kinds can be subordinated or  turned  into clauses, but not by prefixing  t.  The mistake is  not made by good writers, but oc- curs often enough to need mention. One way of avoiding it is to rearrange the sentence so  that  there  is unsub- ordinated quotation of the question etc., and the other is, before subordi- nating,  to convert the question etc. into a statement  giving  the same mean- ing.  Two examples will be enough, the first of an impossible adverbial clause  and the  second  of an equally impossible  substantival.   Crises, international  or national,  arise  so rapidly in these days  that  who can say  what a few years may  bring  forth ?

These are equally good English;  if  that  were shifted from the first to the second,  both  would still  be grammatically correct, but each  less  idiomatic than as it is: the use or omission of the  t.  of a sub- stantival clause depends partly on whether the tone is elevated or collo- quial.  But a glance at the following examples of obviously wrong omission will show  that  there  is not free choice after all verbs or in all constructions: The Italian Olympic Committee an- nounced  all officials,  regardless  of nationality, will wear the same  uniform,  j Looking  back, I  observe  the pattern of the  track left behind wanders  sometimes uncertainly.  /  That  the  suggestion  has been  made by two resident undergradu- ates  indicates little  opposition  may be expected.  /  We learn he used his  cousin  as a  bait.  /  He  urged  an international con- ference  be  held,  j The  enormous  rents which  would be asked for new  houses would  naturally  render  owners  of  existing",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

It at once occurs to the reader  that  announce,  observe,  in- dicate,  learn,  urge  are words  that  stand on their dignity and will not dispense with  the attendance of  t.  The lesson of the last two examples is  that  omission is  unadvisable when the substantival clause  is in apposition to a noun, as here to  result,  and  reason. It may be useful to give tentative lists,  to which everyone can make additions for his own use, of verbs  that (1)  prefer  t.  expressed, (2) prefer  t. omitted,  and (3) vary according to the tone of the  context.  (1)  T.  is usual with  agree,  announce,  argue,  assume, aver, calculate,  conceive,  contend, hold, indicate,  learn, maintain,  observe,  reck- on,  remark, state,  suggest;  (2)  T.  is unusual  with  believe, dare say, pre- sume,  suppose,  think;  (3)  T.  is used or  omitted  with  be told,  confess,  con- sider,  declare, grant, hear, know, per- ceive,  propose,  say, see,  understand.  The verbs  with  which the question may arise  are many more than these  few s which may however be enough to  assist observation. It should be added  that the tendency is to omit  that,  and some of  the words in the first list may be thought to have become eligible for transfer to the third. Perhaps this is due to U.S. influence, where  that is  omitted  much more freely than it is here. It seems clear, from some of the examples given above,  that  this is having  an effect on British journalism. 3.  T.  and  whether  with  doubt(ful). It gave him cause for wonder that no serviceable  [petroleum]  'pool'  had been revealed  in England;  that  any existed, however,  seemed  doubtful, for clearly .  . .  The choice allowed by idiom is between  Whether any existed  seemed doubtful,  and  That  any existed  seemed unlikely,  according to the shade of meaning required. See  DOUBT(FUL). 4.  Interim  t.  A writer often em- barks on a substantival  r.-clause  only to find  that  it is carrying him further than he reckoned, and to feel  that  the reader and he will be lost in a chartless sea  unless they can get back to  port and make a fresh start. His way of effecting  this is to repeat his initial  t. This relieves his own feeling of being lost.  Whether  it helps the inattentive reader is  doubtful;  but it certainly exasperates the attentive reader, who from the  moment  he saw  t.  has been on the watch for the verb it tells him to  expect,  and realizes suddenly, when another  t.  appears,  that  his chart is incorrect.  These interim  thats  are definite grammatical  blunders,  which can  often be mended by leaving out the offending  t.  with  or  without  other superfluous words; in the examples below the omittenda are bracketed. The first two show the most venial form of the mistake, the resumptive  t. being inserted at the  point  from which progress  to the expected verb is not to be  again  interrupted  by subordinate clauses  ;  the others are worse :  Sir F.

What  grammarians say should be has perhaps  less  influence on what shall be than even the more modest of  them realize;  usage  evolves itself little dis- turbed  by their likes and dislikes. And yet the  temptation  to show how  better use might have been made of the material to hand is sometimes irresist- ible.  The  English  relatives, particu- larly  as used by  English  rather than American writers, offer such a  tempta- tion. The relations between  that, who, and  which  have come to us from our forefathers as an odd jumble, and plainly  show  that  the language has not been neatly constructed by a master builder who could create each  part  to do the exact work required of it, neither overlapped nor overlapping;  far  from that,  its parts have had to grow as they could. It might seem orderly  that,  as who  is appropriated to persons, so  that should have been appropriated to things,  or  again  that,  as the relative that  is substantival only, so the relative which  should have been adjectival only. But  we find in fact  that  the antecedent of  that  is often personal, and  which more often represents than agrees with  a noun. We find  again  that while  who  has two possessives  (whose and  of whom),  and  which  one  (of which),  that  has none of its own, though it often needs it, and has to borrow  of which  or  whose.  Such peculiarities are explicable, but not now curable; they are inherent in the relative apparatus   that   we  have received and are bound to work  with. It does not  follow  that  the use we are now making of it is the best it is capable of; and perhaps the line of improvement lies in clearer differen- tiation between  that  and  which,  and restoration of  that  to the place from which, in  print,  it tends to be ousted. A supposed, and misleading, distinc- tion is  that  that  is the colloquial and which  the literary relative.  That  is a false  inference from an actual but mis- interpreted fact. It is a fact  that  the proportion of  thats  to  whichs  is far higher  in speech than in writing; but the reason is not  that  the spoken  thats are  properly converted into  written whichs.  It is  that  the kind of clause properly begun  with  which  is rare in speech  with  its short detached sen- tences, but very common in the more complex and continuous structure of writing, while the kind properly begun with  that  is equally necessary in  both. This  false  inference, however, tends to verify  itself by persuading the writers who follow  rules  of  thumb  actually to change  the original  that  of their thoughts into a  which  for presentation in  print.

 rel.,"one  of  which  that  and to the  other  of which  which  is  appropriate,  are the defining  and the  non-defining;  and if writers would agree  to  regard  that  as the defining relative pronoun,  and which  as  the  non-defining, there would be much  gain  both  in  lucidity  and in ease.  Some there  are who  follow this principle  now;  but it  would  be  idle  to pretend  that  it is the  practice either  of most  or of the  best writers. A  defining relative clause  is one  that identifies  the  person  or  thing meant  by limiting  the  denotation  of the  ante- cedent :  Each made  a  list  of  books  that had  influenced  him  ;  not books  generally, but books as defined by the  that-clause. Contrast  with  this:  /  always  buy his books,  which have  influenced  me  greatly; the clause does  not  limit  his  books, which needs  no  limitation;  it  gives a  reason  (= for  they  have),  or  adds a  new  fact  (= and  they  have).  There is  no  great  difficulty, though often more than  in  this chosen pair, about deciding  whether  a  relative clause  is defining  or not; and the  practice  of using  that  if it  is, and  which  if it is not, would  also  be  easy  but for  certain peculiarities  of  that.  The  most  im- portant  of  these  is its  insistence  on being  the  first word  of its  clause;  it cannot, like  whom  and  which,  endure that  a  preposition governing  it  should, by  coming before  it,  part  it  from  the antecedent  or the  main sentence; such a  preposition has  to  go, instead,  at the end  of the  clause.  (The  book  about which  I  spoke  to you  must become  The book  that  I  spoke  to you about  if  that  is used).  That  is  quite  in  harmony  with the  closer connexion between  a defining  (or  that-)  clause  and the antecedent than between  a non- defining  (or  which-)  clause  and the antecedent;  but it  forces  the  writer to choose between ending his sentence or clause  with  a  preposition, and  giving up  that  for  which.  In the  article PREPOSITION  AT END it is  explained that  to  shrink  with  horror from  end- ing  with  a  preposition  is no  more than foolish   SUPERSTITION;   nevertheless there  are  often particular reasons  for not choosing  that  alternative, and then",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 rel.,"the other must  be  taken,  and the  fact accepted  that  the  preposition-gov- erned  case  of  that  is  borrowed from which,  and its  possessive from  who. Another peculiarity  of  that  is  that  in the defining clauses  to  which  it is proper  it  may,  if it is not the  subject, be omitted  and yet  operative—see  4 below. Another important point  is that  non-defining  clauses need  com- mas  and  defining clauses  do not: Jones,  whom  I  saw yesterday,  told  me, but  Theman  that  Isaw  yesterdaytold  me. The following roman type  sen- tences  (or  parts  of  sentences)  are  re- writings,  in  conformity  with  the account already  given  of  the difference between  that  and  which,  of  verbatim extracts from newspapers;  the  original is  inserted  in  italics below each,  and the reader  is  invited  to  compare  the two versions and  to  say whether, even apart from  the  grammatical theory here maintained,  the  re-writings  do not offer  him a  more natural  and  easy English  than  the  originals.  Where  the reason  for the  change  is not at  once obvious,  a  note  is  added.  But it  will save  repetition  to  state shortly here what  is  explained more fully under WHICH  WITH  AND OR  BUT,  namely  that a  denning  and a  non-defining clause, whether  that  is  used  in  both  or which  in  both,  or  that  in  one and  which in  the  other, ought  not to be  coupled by  and  or  but  as if  they were parallel things. a.

A hatred  of  the rule that is not only unable  to  give  them  protection,  but which  strikes at them blindly and with- out  discrimination.  What  has caused the change from  that  to  which  here is the writer's realizing  that  but that  is somehow undesirable. It is so, because of  the repugnance of  that,  mentioned above,  to being parted from its ante- cedent;  but the way out is to let the previous  that  carry on for  both  clauses, a  task it is quite equal to. g.  She cannot  easily  regain control of the threads of culture  that  she has let drop, which  now  lie in muddled tangles at her feet. She  cannot easily regain  control  of the  threads of culture  which  she has let drop,  and now lie in muddled tangles at her  feet.  The first clause is defining, and should have  that  ;  the second may be de- fining or non-defining, being unessen- tial to the identification and yet capable of  being regarded as helping it. Against allowing  the  that  to carry on, as  in  f, there  is the objection, disregarded in- deed by the writer,  that  the two rela- tives are in different  cases  ; it is there- fore best to make the second clause non-defining, and use  which,  without and. h. The life-work  that  Acton collected innumerable materials for, but never wrote, was a History of Liberty. The  life-work  for which  Acton col- lected  innumerable materials but never wrote  was a History of Liberty.  Restora- tion of the defining  that  often solves the difficulty seen here and in the  next piece,  that  of a relative under double government, first by a preposition and Sien  by a  verb  ; the postponing of the preposition, abnormal though possible with  which,  is  with  that  not  only normal but necessary. j.

After a search for  several  days he found  a  firm  which  had a  large  quantity of  them  and which  they  had no  use  for. Both  clauses are defining, and  that  is required; but the relatives have not the same antecedent, and the  and  is therefore  wrong  (see WHICH WITH AND OR  BUT).  But  there  is a legitimate choice between  that . . . for  and  for which,  and the latter  gives  an escape from one  that-clause  depending on another. 1.

The  second clause  is  clearly non-defining;  the  and should  go. 2.  That-ism.  As has been  explained, the tendency  in  modern writing  is for which  to  supersede  that  even  in the functions  for  which  t.  is  better  fitted. On  the  other  hand some writers seem deliberately  to  choose  that,  where most  other  people would  use  which, under  the  impression  that  its  archaic sound adds  the  grace  of  unusualness to their style.  A  few  examples will show  that  in  non-defining clauses  to be certainly noticeable,  and the  reader will perhaps conclude  that  its  notice- ability  is not a  grace:  But  her fate, that  has  lately been halting  in its pursuit  of  her, overtakes  her at  last.  / This  is  clearly  recognized  by Mr. Macfall  in his  eloquent  and  well illustrated  monograph,  that is  more  than a  mere  record  of the  fortunes  of its titular subject.  /  Neither  . . .,  nor .  .  .,  nor  . . .,  will save the country  if  the town,  that has all the  power  in  its hands, is content to let  it  die.  /  His  arguments  on these  points  were  heard  by the  great audience  of  business  men  in  almost  un- broken  silence,  that gave place  to an outburst  of  applause  when he  .  . . 3.  That  as  relative adverb.  The familiar  yet  remarkable fact  that  a  pre- position governing  that  does  not pre- cede  it but  follows  it at a  distance  has already  been mentioned.  The  idiom now  to be  noticed may  be  traceable  to that  fact.  In the  four following  ex- amples  that  serves  as a  sort  of  relative adverb, equivalent  to  which  with  a preposition:  We  very much question 628",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

(=  with  which). This  is a  freedom  that  should  no more  be  allowed  to  lapse than  the right  of  putting  a  preposition last  or of  omitting  an  objective  that  (see 4 below). But idiom  requires  that  which should  not be so  treated;  it has  been tried,  with  obviously  bad  results,  in: It touched them  in a way  which  no book  in the  world  could touch them.  / The man who cleaned  the  slate  in the way  which  Sir E.  Satow has done both in  Morocco  and Japan.

Ellipsis  of  that.  Both  the  relative adverb  that  and the  relative pronoun are sometimes  omitted,  at  least  in speech.  As  to the  adverb,  At  the  speed he  was  going  he  could  not  stop  and  It happened  on the day we  first  met  are good  colloquial English.  As to the pronoun,  this  is  very  frequently omitted  when  it is the  object  of a defining   clause.  'In the  spoken language'  (says Onions)  'the  tendency is  to  omit  the  relative  as  much  as possible,  and to  prefer (e.g.)  The  book I  am  reading  to  The  book  that  I am reading.'  'In the  written  language',  he adds,  'its  omission  is  often felt  to be undignified';  but  this feeling  is probably  not so  strong now  as it  may",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

This  fact, which you admit, condemns you  cannot be changed to  This  fact, you admit, condemns you  without altering the sense. The omission of the relative pronoun where it is the subject  of a  clause  was formerly a not uncommon  poeticism,  e.g. Shakes- speare's  /  have a  brother  is  condemned to  die  and Tennyson's  What  words are these  have fallen from me,  and may still be found in dialogue  written  in Irish vernacular, e.g.  Herself  will be safe this night with a man killed his father holding  danger from the door.  Other- wise the omission occurs only (as a colloquialism)  after  there  is, he is  etc. (There's  a man wants to speak  to  you; It isn't  everyone  could do  it;  He is not the man he was),  or before  there  is,  e.g. /  know  the difference  there  is between you. 5.  77zaf-clause  not close up. The clinging  of the defining  that  to its antecedent has been noticed in  1.  It is  the gap between it and the ante- cedent  that  occasions a certain dis- comfort in reading the correct sen- tences below. Each  r/zar-clause  is, or may  be meant as, defining; but be- tween  each and the actual noun of the antecedent  (thoroughfare,  fight, formu- lae,  country)  intervenes a clause or phrase  that  would suffice by itself for identification. In such circumstances a  that-clause,  though correct, is often felt to be queer, and it is usually pos- sible  to regard it as non-defining and change  that  to  which.  The reader will probably agree  that  the change would be desirable in some of the four, and in others for special reasons un- desirable  :  'Petty  France'  was the name anciently  borne  by the  thoroughfare  now known as York-street,  that  runs from the  Broadway, Westminster, to Buck- ingham Gate.  I  Dingwall,  which has taken a very active part in the  electoral fight  for  the Wick  Burghs,  that  has resulted  in so striking a Liberal triumph, has other claims upon .  . . /  The foolish formulae  for which the Coalition was responsible,  and  that  the Conservatives have taken over, are not  good  enough.  / When Mr. Raleigh writes, as he  does, as if America was a country of  bounding megalomaniacs,  that  measured every- thing  by size and wealth, he is talking nonsense. 6. One  that  in two  cases.  It is quite in order to let a relative  which  or  that carry  on and serve a second clause as well, but only if  three  conditions are satisfied:  the antecedent of the two must be the  same;  both  must be defining,  or  both  non-defining; and the case of the relative must be the same.  This last condition is violated with  that  in the examples now to be given.  If  there  is a change of  case,  that or  which  must be repeated; or, more often, the repetition should be saved by some change of structure, as sug- gested  in the brackets :  The whole thing is a  piece  of  hypocrisy  of a kind  thztfew associations  would  care  to avow even in committee, but is  here  exhibited un- blushingly  in the light of day  (com- mittee; but here it is exhibited). /  The art  of war  includes  a  technique  that  it is indispensable  to acquire and can only be acquired  by  prolonged  effort  (that  must be  acquired,  but can). See  CASES  3D. 7.  Double government.  A  book  that I  heard of and bought  is a familiar and satisfactory  form of speech;  that  is governed  first by  of  and  again  by bought;  but it is not good enough for those who consider  that  spoken  that should become  written  which,  and  that a  preposition should not end a clause ; they change it to  A  book  of which I heard  and bought,  forgetting  that  if they do not repeat 'which I' this com- mits  them  to  C A  book of which I bought'. Examples have already been given  in h and j of the first section; but the  efficacy  of  that  in making the mistake impossible is so little appre- ciated as to deserve special  treatment. First  an example  that  shows the right form for such needs,  with  that  :  'Com- mand',  by  William  McFee,  is one of those  fine roomy books  that  one lives in with  pleasure  for a  considerable  time and leaves  at the last  page  with  regret.

It is curious  that we use  the  when speaking of ancient writings but not  of  the more recent. We say  The Agammemnon, The  Iliad, but not  The Hamlet, The  Paradise  Lost. We of course use  the  if it is  part  of a title  (  The  Winter's  Tale, The  Doctors' Dilemma)  and we usually do so  also when referring to a work of which  a  is part  of the  title;  we should probably say  That  is a quotationfrom The (not A) Midsummer Night's Dream, Tale of Two Cities,  Shropshire  Lad,  etc. ;  Look it up in The (not A) New Oxford Dic- tionary;  no  doubt  the reason why we substitute the definite article for the indefinite is  that  one or the other is clearly  needed  and the indefinite does not seem to indicate the work  with enough precision. 2.  The Times  correspondent  etc.  It is agreed  that  The Hague Conference  is to  be a meeting of technical experts. The capital T of  The  raises a question that,  however trivial, is for ever pre- senting itself: in 'the Conference at The Hague', or  'the  correspondent of The Times', we know where to use a capital and where a small  letter  ; but when one  the  is cut out by using (  The) Hague  and  (The) Times  attributively instead of as nouns, is the remaining the  that  which belonged to  Hague,  or that  which belonged to  Conference, that  which belonged to  Times  or  that which belonged to  correspondent} and is it consequently to be  The,  or the}  Though compositors or writers often choose the wrong alternative and print  The,  a moment's thought shows that  it is  Conference  or  correspondent that  must have its  the,  while  Hague and  Times  can do  without  it. We say  c a Times correspondent', and 'the last Hague Conference', stripping  Hague and  Times  of their   The  without scruple; it follows  that  the indis- pensable  the  belongs to the other word, and should not be  The  unless after a full stop. 3.  By  the hundred  etc.   The mild revelations  of a  gentle  domestic  existence which  some  royal  personages  have given us command readers  by the hundreds of  thousands.

The  good  and (the}) bad. Primi- tively splendid  dresses,  which appealed after  the manner of barbaric magni- ficence  to  the most complex and ele- mentary  aesthetic instincts.  Is the omission  of another  the most  or another  the  between  and  and  elemen- tary  tolerable? The purist will con- demn it on principle, and probably most of us will, for this particular  case, endorse his condemnation. But he will add  that  neither must we say 'The French, German, and Russian figures are not yet  to  hand', unless we are talking of their combined total; the Germans and the Russians, he will say,  must  have  their separating  the; and in these rigours sensible people will not follow him.  What  may fairly be expected of us is to realize  that among expressions of several ad- jectives  or  nouns introduced by  the some obviously cannot have  the  re- peated   with   each  item   without changing  the sense  (the black and white  penguins) 3  and some can  logically claim  the repetition  (the red and the yellow  tomatoes).

It is  the single-handed courage and  intrepidity  of  these  men which appeal  to the  imagination,  and are even more  marvellous than their adventures. Two nouns of closely allied meaning are  often felt to make no more than a  single  notion;  courage  and intrepidity is  almost a  HENDIADYS  for  intrepid courage.  That feeling is  here  strength- ened by the writer's choosing to use only  one  the  instead of two; and to change  appeal  and  are  to  appeals  and  is would be not only legitimate, but an idiomatic improvement. See  NUMBER  2. 6.  Single  adverbial  the  with  com- paratives.  In  'the  more the  merrier' we have double  the,  in  'They  are none the  better'  we have  single  the,  and  that is  the type to be first discussed. In both  types  the  is not the ordinary ad- jective or  'article',  as in 'the table' etc., but an adverb (or, in the double type, two adverbs); the original meanings were in the double type  by what  (i.e. by how much)  and  by that  (i.e.  by so much),  and in the  single  type  by that (i.e.  thereby  or  on that  account,  or some- times  by so much  or  by that amount). These facts are familiar to all students of  grammar, and are simple enough; but the modern idiom based on  them is  less  easy  to be sure of. It will appear from the extracts presently to be quoted  that  the usage  here  ascribed to the best writers is not universal; it is indeed often violated.  What  is here maintained is  that  good writers do not, and  bad writers do, prefix  the  to com- paratives when it conveys nothing at all;  and  again  that  good writers do not, and  bad writers do, allow themselves a  than  after a comparative  that  has the  before it. The second and more limited question may be taken first, and  disposed of by  saying  roundly  that the  the  should never be used  with a  comparative if  than  follows. In the following extracts for instance the the  form should be got rid of in the first two by the omission of  the  with- out any consequential changes and in the last two by changing  none the  to no.  I  do  not  believe  that the New Royalty productions  would have  pleased  people any  the more than at present  by having money  lavished upon  scenery  (any the more = any more than if money had not been lavished). /  A  sentence  in the courts  of summary  jurisdiction  has not any  the  less  effect  upon the status and prospects  of a  prisoner  than  a  sentence  in the  superior  courts  (any the  less  effect = any  less  effect than if it were not in courts of summary jurisdiction). /  But does  that make  Sophocles  more  Greek than Aeschylus or  Euripides?  Each of the  latter may be  more  akin  to  other poets;  but he is  none the  less  Greek than  Sophocles  (none the  less  Greek = no  less  Greek than if he were not more akin  to other  poets)./ Meanwhile  the in- tellectual  release  had  been  none the  less marked than  the physical. As  to the more general question of when a  single  adverbial  the  is ap- propriate and when it is out of place before a comparative,  without  the complication of a following  than,  a fashion  seems to have grown up of in- serting  an indefensible  the  in the  false belief  that  it is impressive or literary. Such  fashions are deplorable; it is wisdom either to abstain altogether from the adverbial  the  or to clear one's ideas  about what one means by it. The function of this  the  is to remind or acquaint the reader  that  by looking about he may find indicated the cause (or sometimes the amount, if  the means  by so much  rather than  thereby) of  the excess stated by the compara- tive. If no such indication is to be found earlier or later in the  passage, the  has no justification, and merely sets  readers searching for what they will  not find. Correct examples are: /  am the  more  interested  in his exploit because  he is my  cousin,  where  the anticipates  because  etc.;  Thoitgh  he is my cousin I am not the  more  likely to agree  with him,  where  the  refers back to  though  etc.;  As the hour  approached",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In  the examples  that  follow it will be found impossible to  point  to such a  cause or measure of excess anti- cipated or recalled by  the,  and  more- over it will probably be  admitted  at once  that  removal of  the  does not weaken the sense, but improves it. First will come some quotations each meant to convey something of this sort:  'Asays  so-and-so;(thatreally does not  much  concern us ;)  what  con- cerns us more is so-and-so else' ; but in each  a  the  has been gratuitously inserted, with  nothing for it to anticipate or recall;  the bracketed sentence above is  not usually expressed, but it or an equivalent is a necessary  part  of the sense  :  But whilst the  origin  of words is a very fascinating study, we are at the moment  the more interested  in some of the language used at yesterday's demon- strations.

These are simple affairs ; the reader is mystified for a  moment  by  the,  but soon sees  that  all he has to do is to neglect it. The  next  examples are not quite  so simple, because each con- tains some expression, of a kind com- monly associated  with  this  the,  that nevertheless is not to be associated with  it here and, if it is so taken, will spoil the sense :  It is  socially  inexpedient that the diseased should languish un- attended  because  of inability to provide skilled  assistance,  and it is  not the less inexpedient  that the  prisoner  should stand unaided  before  justice  because  his means cannot  secure  legal representation. The  because  clause does not explain  the, as  one might  guess,  but belongs to stand  unaided.  /  It  is  gratifying to  receive such  clear testimony to a widespread interest  in an intelligent study of the Bible;  and it is  not the less gratifying that  many  recent  books deal with the subject  from a  special  point of  view.

In these examples the use of  the  goes beyond mere  ineptitude, and amounts to the serious offence of laying  FALSE SCENT.

there.,"In  the well-known special use of  there  before  be, exist,  and such verbs, two things call  for  notice. First,  the use  is  anticipatory,  i.e.  there  accom- panies  and  announces inversion  of verb and subject, standing in the place usually  occupied before  the  verb  by the  subject;  consequently, when there is  no  inversion, this  there  is out of place,  and should  be  struck out, e.g., in  :  Bombay is without  a  doubt the head- quarters  of  whatever cricket there exists in India today.  An  exception must however be made for the verb  be  itself; 'whatever cricket there is'  is  English, though  'whatever  cricket there  exists' is  not. The  reason  is  easy  to  see.  In inversions,  there  has become  so  regu- lar  an  attendant  on  is,  are,  was  etc. when used as  a  substantive verb  (i.e.= exist)  that  even when there  is no in- version  the  need  is  felt  of  inserting  it as  a  sign  that  the  verb must  be  taken in  its  substantive sense,  not as aux- iliary  or  copulative.  But  with  other verbs,  about which there  is no  such doubt,  no  such  sign  is  wanted,  and there  is  used only  with  inversion. The second thing  that  calls  for notice  is  that,  since  in the  there  idiom verb precedes subject, there is a danger of  the  verb's being hastily  put  into the wrong number;  for  examples  see NUMBER  7.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In the following example it is clear  that thereby  means by the  salary  etc.; but whether  affording  agrees  with  salary etc., so  that  the  salary  affords encour- agement by the  salary,  or whether it agrees  with  'firm'  looming in the distance,  the writer probably knows as  little as we :  The latter is usually the recipient  of a  liberal  salary  and  expenses, with  periodical  increments,  holidays, and security,  thereby affording  every en- couragement  to  promote  the interests of his firm. therefor, therefore. The two are now distinct in accent and meaning as  well as in spelling.  Therefor  is accented on the second syllable,  there- fore  on the first; and  therefor  is to be used only where  for that, for it, for them,  etc., could stand equally well. In grammatical terms,  therefore  is an adverbial  conjunction, and  therefor  an adverbial  or adjectival phrase (adver- bial  in  He was punished  therefor,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 and,"adjectival  in  The penalty  therefor  is death) .  The essential function of  there- fore  is to make clear the relation of its sentence to what has gone before;  that of  therefor  is the same as  that  of  there- after, thereat, therein, thereof,  thereto, therewith,  etc., usual in  legal  documents but elsewhere serving only to  give  a touch of formality  or  archaism to the sentence in which it is substituted for the  for it  etc. of natural speech. therefore. Apart from the danger of meaning  therefor  and writing  there- fore  or vice versa, the only caution needed is  that  discretion is necessary in  the use of commas before and after words of the  class  to which  t.  belongs. Like  then, accordingly,  nevertheless, consequently,  and many others, it is an adverb often used (itself, indeed, al- most always) as a conjunction; and it is a  matter  of taste whether such adver- bial  conjunctions shall or shall not be comma'd off from the rest of the sen- tence in which they stand. Light punc- tuators usually omit the commas (or comma, if  t.  stands  first),  heavy punc- tuators usually  give  them,  and  both  are within their  rights.  But it must be re- membered  that  the  putting  of a comma before  t.  inevitably has the effect of throwing a strong accent on the pre- ceding  word, and  that  some preceding words are equal to  that  burden, and some are not. From the  three  follow- ing  examples it will be at once apparent that  the  although  can bear the commas,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

Probably  that  is the  case,  and the com- mas  are justified; but if the light punc- tuation were  generally  accepted as the rule  with  these adverbial conjunctions, and commas used only when emphasis on the preceding word was desired, one of the numberless small points  that make for lucidity would be gained. A curious specimen may  be  added: We  therefore  are  brought  again to the study of  symptoms.  Here it is obvious that  We  is  unemphatic  ; but the writer, though he has rightly abstained from commas, has been perverse enough to throw  an accent on  We  by other means, viz.  by  putting  therefore  before instead of  after  are. they,  them,  their.  1.

The  concluding  sentence  runs: 'And we trust  that everybody  interested  will send a  contribution, however small, to this object,  thereby demonstrating their {sic) personal  interest in the anti-Home Rule campaign*.  Archbishop Whately used to  say that women  were  more  liable than men to  fall  into  this  error,  as they ob- jected  to identifying  'everybody*  with 'him*.  But no such excuse is available in this  case.  Undoubtedly grammar rebels against  their;  and the reason for using  it is clearly reluctance to recog- nize  that,  though  the  reference may be to  both  sexes, the right shortening of the cumbersome  he  or  she, his or her, etc., is  he  or  him  or  his,  as  his  and  him are used  with  a boldness surprising in a  government  department  in  There must be opportunity for the individual boy  or  girl  to  go  as  far as his  keenness  and ability  will take  him.  Whether  that reluctance is  less  felt by the male is doubtful; at any rate the OED quotes examples from Fielding  {Everyone  in the  house  were  in their beds),  Gold- smith, Sydney Smith, Thackeray  {A person  can't  help their birth),  Bagehot {Nobody  in their  senses),  and Bernard Shaw.  It  also  says  nothing more severe of  the use than  that  it is 'Not favoured by grammarians'. In colloquial usage the inconvenience of having no com- mon-sex personal pronoun in the singular  has proved stronger than re- spect for the grammarians, and the one that  is available in the plural is made to serve  for the singular too. But in prose their disfavour is not treated so lightly; few good modern writers would flout them  so conspicuously as Fielding and Thackeray did  in  the sentences quoted, or as Ruskin in /  am never angry with anyone  unless they  deserve  it.   The question is discussed in  NUMBER  II: examples of the wrong  their,  in addi- tion to those  that  follow, will be found under  THEIR;  and the article  ONE  5,6, 7,  may be useful.

(The winner will be  selected  from)  those persons  named',  persons  is the noun, and named  the adjective. This arrange- ment  is now very common but is so little warranted by good literary usage that  the OED, which illustrates the constructions of which this is a hybrid product,  does not quote a  single  ex- ample of it; cf.  what  is said of the same construction under  THAT,  adj. 2. The word  adjective  in the formula above is to be taken as including participles active or  passive,  and adjectival phrases, as  well as simple  adjectives—whatever, in fact, is equivalent to a defining rela- tive clause  (those  persons  following,  those persons  named,  those  persons  in the list below,  those  persons  present —all  equiva- lent to  the  persons  that  etc.).  Those named  is a proper substitute for  (the) persons  named,  the pronoun (not adjec- tive)  those  taking the place of the noun persons  with  or  without  the,  and  (the) persons  named  is itself a shortening of the  persons  that are named.  But  those persons  named  is a  mixture  of the long form  (the)  persons  that are named  and the short form  those  named,  in which mixture  what  was gained by using the pronoun  those  instead of  the  persons  is thrown  away by reinserting the noun and making  those  an adjective. It is true  that  there  is another legitimate form in which  those  does appear as an adjective,  viz.  those  persons  who are named;  but  that  is a form in which  what is  aimed at is not lightness and brevity, but on the contrary formality and precision; it is therefore not one that  should be abbreviated. All this is offered not as a proof  that those  persons  named  is impossible gram- mar, but as a reasonable explanation of  what  is believed to be the fact,  that good  writers do not say it, but say either  (the)  persons  named  or  those named.  The following quotation is useful as containing samples  both  of the right and of the wrong usage :  It depends  upon the extent to which  those in authority  understand their  responsi- bility, and are able so to make their influence  felt as to enlist the active sup- port  of  those boys  with  most influence in the  school.

They are: first  that though  can and  although  cannot be used as  an adverb, placed last  (He said he would  come;  he  didn't,  though);  and secondly  that  though  is alone possible in the  as though  idiom. In the use common to  both  forms, i.e. as a com- plete  conjunction, no definite line can be drawn between  them,  and either is  always admissible. But it is safe to say,  in the first place,  that  though  is much commoner, and, secondly,  that the conditions in which  although  is likely  to occur are (a) in the more formal style of writing, (b) in a clause that  does not follow but precedes the main sentence, and perhaps (c) in stating an established fact rather than a  mere hypothesis:  He  wouldn't take an umbrella though it should rain cats  and  dogs;  Although he attained the  highest  office,  he  zoas  of  mediocre ability. 2.

The convenience of this is  obvious, but care is needed, as ap- pears  from the two quotations  that follow:  Though  new  to  mastership  her- self, a lady master is not new to  the  pack, for she  follows  Mrs. Garvey in the  posi- tion.  I  Though  sympathizing  as  I  do  with Poland,  I cannot  resist  the  impression that it would be doing  Poland  an ill service  to. . . .  The point shown by the first is  that  the omission must not be made when it leaves the participle or adjective apparently attached to a wrong noun.  New  in fact belongs to she,  but seems to belong to  a lady master;  if  she is  had not been omitted after  though,  all would have been in order. In the  Poland  sentence, the correction really required is to omit though,  'sympathizing  as I do' being self-sufficient.  But, even if we suppose as  I  do  omitted, there is a wrong sound about  though sympathizing  itself  that suggests  a limitation on this idiom. Though,  and other conjunctions, must not be constructed  with  a participle unless  that  participle would have been used in the unabridged clause; and that  would not have been  though I am sympathizing,  but  though I sympathize.

trailers.,"Under  this  name  a few specimens are collected of the  sort  of sentence  that  tires the reader out by again  and again disappointing his  hope of  coming  to an end. It is noticeable that  writers  who  produce  trailers pro- duce  little  else, and  that  where  one fine example  occurs  there  are sure to be more  in the neighbourhood. The ex- planation probably is  that  these  gentle- men have on the one hand a copious pen, and on the  other  a dislike  (most natural,  their  readers  must  agree) to reading over  what  it may have set down.  Whatever  its cause, the trailer style is  perhaps  of all styles the  most exasperating. Anyone who was con- scious of  this  weakness  might  do  much to  cure  himself by taking a pledge to use no relative  pronouns  for a year; but  perhaps  most  of its victims are unconscious.   This  type  of  wicket is always  trappy, one ball coming first on to the bat,  with  another hanging fire, which so frequently causes a catch to be given by the  batsman  playing too  quickly, as Hallows appeared to do when caught and bowled by  Macaulay,  when he pro- mised a  good  innings, in spite of being missed  at fine  leg  from a ball which cer- tainly  should have been caught, since the ball  was played and not hit off the  legs.  / It is true  that  part of the traffic here is heavy, but at least the surface might be conditioned  by modern methods, even if the  form  of  paving cannot well be altered, though I think it ought to  be — e.g.,  if Sydney  Smith's  suggestion  as to the  wood pavement problem perplexing an old vestry — 'Gentlemen,  put your heads to- gether,  and the  thing""s  done' — is  im- practicable,  there are now improved means open to a modern  City  Council, both in surface dressing, in hard woods, and even in macadam, by the use of slag — locally  called  dross — from  the iron furnaces in Yorkshire, which makes the hardest and smoothest  surface,  j It may be  that  the modification of our  Free Trade  principles to a sufficient form of Fair  Trade  will be all  that  is necessary to prevent the final decline, which  prob- ably  the pinch of the last few years has prevented  from setting  in  from a previous run of prosperity, which, by causing the easy realization of fine old businesses under the seductive lines of Limited Liability, has resulted  in  the  'Super man' being eliminated in favour of a joint control in which the divergence of  opinion  among Directors  with  little personal  interest has prevented a uni- formity and continuity of policy abso- lutely essential in the management of any  business  with  widespread interests. / Against  this  portrait of  an  ogress-devourer of  talent one must set the unselfish devo- tion she gave to Mahler and  Werf  el  and her  lifelong  friendships  with  Hauptmann and the  Bergs  {Madame  Berg  was an illegitimate daughter of the Emperor Franz  Joseph) : and so one must give her the benefit of the doubt and assume  that, despite her man-eating propensities, she possessed  that  Austrian  charm  of the most rare  kind  which blends inherited good  breeding  with  habitual acceptance of  the moods of genius and makes a stimulating listener and comforting friend  out of the tweed-capped and finely booted  hostess of Semmering or Venice or  Vienna  or even of Beverley Hills; one  of those warm stoves round whom expatriates rally.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

"transparent,","and  the  synonyms  dia- phanous,  pellucid, translucent. Trans- parent  is  the  general word  for  describ- ing  what  is  penetrable  by  sight (lit.  or fig.)  or  by  light,  and it can be  sub- stituted  for any of the  others unless there  is  some  point  of  precision  or  of rhetoric  to be  gained. All  three  syno- nyms have the rhetorical value of being less  common than  transparent,  and therefore appear more often  in  poetical writing.  As  regards precision,  the following  definitions  of the  words' narrower senses  are  offered,  and to each are appended some specially ap- propriate nouns, and  the  adjective  or participle  that  seems most directly opposed. That  is  diaphanous  which does  not preclude sight  of  what  is  behind  it; material,  film;  opp.  shrouding. That  is  transparent  which does  not even obscure  sight  of  what  is  behind it  and  transmits light  without  diffu- sion;  glass,  candour,  pretence;  opp. obscuring. That  is  pellucid  which does  not  dis- tort  images seen through  it;  water, literary  style;  opp.  turbid. That  is  translucent  which does  not bar the passage of light  but  diffuses  it; alabaster,  tortoise-shell;  opp.  opaque.

The last of these adds to the wrong meaning of  t.  an  unidio- matic construction after it in the in- finitive  to  be.  That  construction will not do even when  t.  has its  true  sense; that  sense is complete in itself, and transpired  to  be.  is as little  English  as came  to light to be:  here is the right sense  followed by the wrong construc- tion:  They must have been aware of the possibility  that  the  facts might be as they ultimately  transpired  to be.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The indignation of the ex- president is understandable, but the custom  that  provoked it will not be easily  dislodged. The use of  t.  as an opprobrious  term  for a person dates from the  16th  c;  the OED quotes Sayest  thou  me  so thou Tripe,  thou hated  scorn,  which suggests  that  even then  it  must  have been felt to be pretty  powerful invective.

Any  Latin agent-noun  in -tor  could form  a  feminine  in  -trix, and some  of  these when taken into English  continue  to do  so, especially such as are, like  testator  and  prosecutor, in  legal  use. It is a  serious incon- venience  that  the  Latin plural  is  -ices (-ïsëz);  if the  Latin quantity  is pre- served,  the  accent has  to be  shifted  in the plural, which makes  the  word hardly  recognizable. The result  is  that it  is  sometimes given  up  as  a  bad job; OED  gives  e.g.  prosecu'trices  and  radices (radix  is  like  the  -trix  words,  with Latin  pi.  radl'ces),  and allows  matrix  a popular  ma'trices  (or even  matrixes)  by the side  of a  correct  matrl'ces;  but for cicatrix  it  allows only  -trï'ces,  and for  directrix  and  executrix  states only  that  the  pi.  is  -ices  and leaves us  to deal  with  quantity  and  accent  as we please.

Another way of  escape  would be to use the masculine form and drop the feminine. This has distinguished advocacy.  'There  is no such word as executrixes'  said  a judge to counsel who had found difficulty in articulating the anglicized  plural. 'The word is  exécu- trices,  and even  that  is bad enough. There is no feminine of  executor.  My father,  if he found such a word in a document,  would strike it out in wrath and  consign the document to the waste paper basket. ""Executors"" he would say  ""are always masculine in form though often feminine in fact"".' This provoked a  letter  to  The Times  from the Senior Registrar of Probate. 'It has  long been the practice' he  said  'of the devotees of the somewhat  esoteric cult of  probate  freely to employ the word  executrixes  . . . and where a testator or testatrix, urged possibly by humility or pride respectively, has appointed persons  falling  within the category,  signature and  seal  have for many  years approved its use.'

The  etymologist  is aware,  and the person who has paid no attention to the subject is probably un- aware,  that  a  belfry  is not named from its  bell;  that  a  child's  cot  and  a  sheep- cot  come from different  languages; that  Welsh rabbit  is amusing and right, and  Welsh  rarebit  stupid and wrong; that  isle  and  island  have nothing  in common etymologically;  and  that pygmy  is a  more significant spelling than  pigmy.  But  to  know when  it is well  to  call an island an  isle  and when it is not is  worth  more than to know all these etymological facts.  Still,  etymo- logy  has its uses, even for those whose sole  concern  with  it is as an aid to writing and  a  preventive  of  blunders  ; some  knowledge of it may save us from treating  protagonist  as the  opposite of  antagonist,  or  from supposing  a watershed  to be a  river-basin,  or  from materializing  the  comity of  nations  into either  a  committee  or a  company  of them,  or from thinking  that  to  demean oneself  is necessarily  to  lower  oneself or  do a  mean  thing  or  that  an  alibi can  be  used  for  any sort  of  excuse. But  the  etymology providing such stray  scraps  of  useful knowledge  re- lates  much more  to the  French  and Latin  elements  in our  language than to  its  native  or  Teutonic substratum.

It is  still customary  for the Sovereign,  when issuing  a  commission to one of her subjects,  to  address him as  her  trusty  and  well-beloved,  her right  trusty and  right  well-beloved  if he  is a  privy councillor. (See  also RELATION  2).  Otherwise the word is no longer  in use  except  as a  deliberate archaism.  That  is a pity, for  it  is a good word, much  better  than  its  drab cousin  trustworthy,  which enjoyed unmerited popularity  in the  days when pedants could  not  bring  them- selves  to use  reliable  (see  -ABLE,  4).

The idiom  t.  and do  something is  described as colloquial for  t.  to do. Its use  is  probably commonest  in  ex- hortations  and  promises:  Do t.  and stop  coughing',  I  will  t.  and have  it ready  for  you.

It  is, therefore, colloquial, if  that  means specially appropriate  to actual speech;  but not if  colloquial means below  the  proper standard  of literary dignity. Though  t. to  do  can always  be substituted for  t.  and do,  the latter  has a  shade  of  meaning  that justifies  its  existence;  in  exhortations it implies  encouragement—the  effort will  succeed—;  in  promises  it  implies assurance—the  effort shall succeed.

twilit.,"The earliest OED quotation for  the word is  1869,  so  that,  whatever its merits may be, it is not venerable.

It  also implies  that  to  twilight  has p.p.  twilit rather than  twilighted,  which is not im- possible.  But, though  twilit  can there- fore not be absolutely ruled out, it is better  to use  twilight  attributively where  that  does the work as well, as it usually  does, and elsewhere to do  with- out. In the two following quotations, twilight  would have served at least as well:  He found  himself  free  of a fanciful world  zvhere  things happened as he preferred — a  twilit  world  in which sub- stance  melted into shadow.

Total differentiation has  taken place between  ingenuity  and ingenuousness,  casualty  and  casualness, sensibility  and  sensibleness,  enormity  and enormousness',  the use  of""  either form instead of the other changes or des- troys the meaning. Partial differentia- tion results from the more frequent use made of the -ty words. Both termina- tions have, to start  with,  the abstract sense  of the quality for which the ad- jective stands; but while most of the -ness  words, being little used, remain abstract and still denote quality only, many of the -ty words acquire by much  use various concrete meanings in  addition; e.g.,  humanity,  curiosity, variety,  beside the senses  'being  human, curious, various', acquire those of  'all human beings', 'a curious object', and 'a  sub-species'. Or  again  they may be habitually applied in a limited way so that  the full sense of the adjective is no longer naturally suggested by  them; preciosity  is limited to literary or artis- tic style,  maturity  suggests  the moment of  reaching rather than the state of matureness,  purity  and  frailty  take a sexual tinge  that  pureness  and  frailness are  without,  poverty  is more nearly confined to lack of money than  poor- ness.

The  true  meanings of the words are as  follows : ANTETYPE   ('a  preceding type, an earlier  example'—OED)  is a rare word  that  should hardly ever be used, first because its similarity in sound and opposition in sense to the established antitype  is inconvenient, secondly as being liable to confusion  with  proto- type  also from  their  closeness in mean- ing,  and thirdly because  forerunner  is ready to take its place  when  it really does not mean  prototype. ANTITYPE,   unlike the others, is not a type.  Type  and  antitype  are a complementary pair or correlatives: the  type  is the symbol or emblem or pattern  or model, and the antitype ('lit.  responding  as  an impression to the  die'—OED)  is the person or object or fact or event in the sphere of reality  that  answers to its specifica- tion. PROTOTYPE,   on the  other  hand, serves,  with  limitations, as a synonym for  type.  In particular it may be pre- ferred (i) to emphasize (like  archetype, see  below) the priority in  time  of  a certain  type  over its antitype, or (ii) when  type,  which has  other  senses, might be ambiguous, or (iii)  when typification  itself is of no great consequence, and the sense wanted is no more  than  'the earliest form' of something.

The shibboleths whose observance are  said  to  distinguish  the U  from the Non-U,  so far as  they are matters of  pronunciation,  are,  though more esoteric,  similar  to  those  that  mark  the division  between  the  minority  who speak  with the  RECEIVED  PRONUNCIA- TION  and the  majority  who do not. The element common  to  both—the notion  of  a  select  class  recognizable  by the way  it  speaks—no  doubt  accounts for  the  spleen  of  some  of the  attacks made  on the  Received Pronunciation by  critics touchy about such things. See  that  article.  Other  shibboleths,  no less  important, depend  on the  choice of  words. Articles  in  this dictionary with  a  bearing  on  what,  by 'U'  stan- dards  are  (to  borrow  Ross's  adjectives) 'correct,  proper, legitimate  or  appro- priate' include those  on  ESQUIRE, EUPHEMISMS,  GENTEELISMS,  GIRL, GOLF, HON., LADY, LETTER FORMS, LORD, NAMES  and  APPELLATIONS, PRONUN- CIATION, RALPH,  RECESSIVE  ACCENT, REVEREND,  SIR,  and  TITLES.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

"ultra,","originally  a  Latin preposition and adverb meaning beyond,  was adopted  as an  English  noun  in the early  19th  c.  (pi.  -as)  meaning  a  person who  goes  beyond others  in  opinion  or action  of the  kind  in  question. This was  no  doubt  a  development of its use as  a  prefix  in  such adjectives  (and nouns)  as  ultra-fashionable(s),  ultra- revolutionary  (-ries).  Such compounds were curtailed into  ultra  adj.  and n.; but this was  no  longer felt  to be,  like sub  when used  for  subaltern  or  sub- scription,  a  CURTAILED WORD.  It Won independence  of  any second element, its  own  meaning being sufficient, and became  a  synonym  for the now more usual  extremist. (Even  some  of  the former  ultras are making  the  discovery that the Common Market issue remains a  balance  of  advantages  and  disad- vantages.)  Fanatical ultras  in any cause  are now known  by the  collective term  lunatic  fringe,  which  has  been described  as 'a  splendidly prejudicial British  phrase,  with  its  suggestion  of hair  dragged villainously low over  the forehead  or  edging  the  circumference of  the face  in the  way  that  magistrates so  disapprove  of.

But to those who are not content to accept words as  arbitrary tokens, and do not see why a papal zealot should be an 'over-the-hills'  man,  an explanation may be welcome. The mountains are the Alps,  and beyond the mountains means, to an Italian, outside Italy, and, to others, in Italy. So, when  there  were differences  in the Church about the right relation between the Italian bishops and the extra-Italian, each party could describe the other as the Ultramontanes, which makes the his- torical use of the word confusing. In modern use it is applied, chiefly by opponents, to the party of Italian pre- dominance, whose principle is the absolute supremacy of the Pope, and the denial of independence to national Churches. ultra vires.

 TO.,"The conscious  or  unconscious  as- sumption  that  a  participle  or  adjective has  acquired  the  powers  of  preposi- tion  or  adverb when  it has in  fact  not done  so  perhaps accounts  for  most of  the  unattached  and  wrongly  at- tached;  but  there  are  many  for  which no such excuse  is  possible. Before pro- ceeding  to  them,  let us  make  a few sentences  containing undoubtedly con- verted participles, sentences  in  which the seeming participle  is not  felt  to need  an  associated noun  or  pronoun: Talking  of  test matches,  who won the last?;  Coming  to  details,  the  spoilt ballot-papers  were  17;   Barring  ac- cidents,  it  ought  to  work;  Seeing  that it  is  fine  now, a  start  may as  well  be made;  They  are  illiterate (using  the word  in its  widest  sense);  Granting  his honesty,  he may be  mistaken;  Failing you,  there  is no  chance  left; Twelve  were saved,  not  counting  the  dog; Allowing for  exceptions,  the  rule  may stand.  It is natural,  and  perhaps right,  to  explain this common type  as  originally  not a participle  at all, but a  shortening  of the gerund preceded  by  the  old preposition  a;  talking of  —  a-talking  of, i.e.  in  talking  or  while  there  is  talk  of. However  that  may be, it is  only fanatical  purists  who  will condemn such  sentences,  and a  clear acknow- ledgement  of  their legitimacy should strengthen rather than weaken  the necessary  protest  against  the  slovenly uses  now to be  illustrated.

As the lapses from idiom here to be illustrated probably owe their origin to the modern wider extension of grammatical knowledge, it  may be  prudent  to start by con- ciliating  the sticklers for grammar and admitting  that  a -ly is sometimes missing  where it is wanted. So:  The Carholme  course,  shaped very  similar to  the Doncaster Town Moor, is one of  the best in England.  /  Proceedings  in- stituted  by the local Education Com- mittee  against the mother for  neglecting to  send  her  girl  to  school  regular. / /  hope that most teachers in the  present  day have learnt to read the Old Testament {thanks to the higher critics)  different from  the way I was taught to read it in my  youth,  j Surely no peace-loving man or woman will deny that it  would be  advisable to prevent strikes and lock-outs  consistent  with the principles of  liberty as set forth by John Stuart Mill. But, if grammar is inexorable against consistent  and  different  and the rest, it would in the following sentences allow contrary  and  irrespective  without  a frown, while idiom for its  part  would welcome  them  :  The provision is quite inadequate and very  grudgingly  granted, and often,  contrarily  to the spirit of the Act, totally denied.  /  Loyal  obedience  is due to the  'powers  that be', as such, irrespectively  of their historical  origin.  / His method is to whitewash them all vigorously  with the same brush,  irrre- spectively  of differences in the  careers and characters of his  heroes.  Contrary and  irrespective  are among the adjec- tives  that  have,  with  others men- tioned in  UNATTACHED  PARTICIPLES  and in  QUASI-ADVERBS,  developed adverbial force;  to ignore  that  development is bad literary judgement, but, among the mistakes made  with  -ly, one of the least. A degree worse is the use of a -ly adverb where idiom requires not an adverb at all, but a predicative adjec- tive. See  LARGE(LY)  for the phrases bulk  and  loom  large,  and  substitute adjectives for adverbs in the four following quotations :  In neither direc- tion  can we fix our  hopes  very  highly. / This- country was  brought  much  more closely  to disaster at sea than ever the Allies  were  on land  (much  closer). /",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

unidiomatic -ly,"It is a gigantic labour  before  which the labours  of Westphalia, of Utrecht, of Vienna, pale  insignificantly. Some- times indeed it would not be  easy  to say  whether  a predicative adjective or an  adverb is more idiomatic. It does not  matter  which we call  hard, bright, and  wide  in  It  froze  hard, the  fire burned  bright, the  doors  were  flung open wide',  the adverbial or adjectival form can  be used  with  equal propriety in He played the melody  loud(ly),  it was dangling  loose{ly),  they  sat  idl(e)(y)  by the  fire,  when trenching dig  deep(ly). Pedantic criticism is often heard of harmless  injunctions suchas  Drive slow, Hold  tight, Turn sharp left  :  there  is an old joke about a drowning lady who when adjured by her rescuer to hold tight 'murmured  say tightly  as she went  down for the third time'. If such phrases really need to be justified grammatically,  this tendency for the adverb and adjective to merge affords a  colourable plea. Yet a little worse is the officious bringing  up to date of such time- honoured phrases as  mighty  kind,  sure enough  and  safe and sound: Still, it is mightily kind of the  Morning Post  to be so  anxious to shield the Labour Party from  the wrath to  come.  /  We begin to remember  the  story of the detective who died  murmuring to himself  'More  clues!' and towards the end of the  book,  surely enough,  more  clues  there  are.  / /  hope your  daughter will get home safely and soundly, Mrs. F. But  much more to be deprecated than all the particular  departures from idiom already mentioned is the growing  notion  that  every common adjective,  if an adverb is to be made of it, must have a -ly clapped on to it to proclaim the fact.

" RIGHT, and","STRAIGHT.  Two such words may here be  taken  for  special  treatment, much(ly)  as the least, and  hard(ly)  as the most, important of all. We all know  that  much  can be an adverb, and probably most of us would guess  that muchly  was a modern facetious forma- tion, perhaps meant to burlesque the ultra-grammatical, and at any rate always  used jocosely. We should be wrong; it is over 300 years old. Its earliest  use was serious, and even now it may occasionally be met in con- texts  where the  point  of the joke is not apparent :  Many players who  were in the habit of relying muchly upon the advice  of their  caddies  found  themselves completely  at sea.  Nevertheless, as it seems  from the OED to have lain dor- mant for over 200 years, our guess is not so far out, and its revival in the 19th  c. illustrates the belief  that  ad- verbs must end in -ly.  Muchly  does not often make its way into  print, except  in dialogue as a recognized symbol of the mildly jocose talker, and has  been  worth  attention only in con- trast  with  hardly.  That,  as will appear, is  substituted in  print  for the idio- matic  7 :ard  neither seldom nor  with any  burlesque intention, but seem- ingly  in ignorance. Ignorance  that hard  can be an adverb  seems  incredible when one thinks  of  Hit him hard, Work hard, Try hard,  and so forth  ;  the ignor- ance must be of idiom rather than of grammar. Neglect of idiom is, in this case,  aggravated by the danger  that hardly,  written  as meaning hard, may be read as meaning scarcely; for some proofs  that that  danger is real, see the article  HARDLY.  The examples  that here follow are free from such am- biguity,  but in each of  them  idiom demands expulsion of the -ly:  How hardly  put to it the Tories  are  for  argu- ment is shown by  ... /  Another  sign  of how  hardly the  great  families  are  pressed in these times.  /  The invasion of Henley by the fashionable  world  bears very hardly on  those  who go only for the sport.

In the first place, it is applicable only to  what  is in some respect the sole existing specimen, the precise like of which may be sought  in vain.  That  gives  a clean line of  division  between  it and the many adjectives for which it is  often ignorantly  substituted— remarkable,  ex- ceptional,  fabulous,  rare,  marvellous, and the like. In  the  qualities rep- resented by those  epithets  there  are degrees  ;  but uniqueness is a  matter  of yes  or no only; no unique thing is more or  less  unique than another unique thing, as a rare thing may be rarer or  less  rare than another rare thing. The adverbs  that  u.  can tolerate are e.g.  quite, almost, nearly, really, surely,  perhaps, absolutely,  or  in some respects',  and it is nonsense to call any- thing  more,  most, very, somewhat, rather,  or  comparatively u.  Such nonsense,  however, is often  written: What  made Laker's  achievement  all the more unique was.... / /  am now at one of  the most unique  writers'  colonies imaginable.  / /  have just  come  across  the production  of a boy  aged  seven which is, in my  experience,  somewhat unique. / Sir,  I venture to send you a copy of  a rather unique  inscription  on a  tombstone. IA  very unique  child, thought I. But, secondly,  there  is another set of  synonyms— sole,  single,  peculiar to, etc.—from  which  u.  is divided not by a  clear difference of meaning, but by an idiomatic limitation (in English though not in French) of the contexts to which it is suited. It will be admitted  that  we improve the two following sentences if we change  u.  in the first into  sole,  and",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The word is so attrac- tive because it seems to combine the most forcible sound  with  the haziest meaning. Clearly  the word cannot now be restored to its severely philosophical sense  (as shown in the first of the quotations  that  follow). Its most fre- quent  use today is as a convenient way of  saying  that  a particular eventuality is  by common consent too  silly  or too wicked or too horrible to contemplate (as  in quotations 2, 3, and 4).  That  is a reasonable extension. But to call some project unthinkable merely by way of expressing one's own emphatic dis- agreement  with  it (as in quotations 5 and 6), or to describe as unthinkable a  state of affairs actually existing at the time  (as in quotations 7 and 8) is to use the word in a sense so plainly incongruous  with  its natural meaning as  to make it  pointless;  it becomes merely an expletive.  1.  'Ultimate' scientific  ideas may be unthinkable with- out  prejudice to the  'thinkableness'  of 'proximate'  scientific  ideas.  2.  First  and foremost  we must  continue  to make it evident  that the  cost  of major  aggression is  unthinkably  high.  3.

He said we  were  apt to forget  the  lessons  of the war;  some  people he  met said  '/  want to  forget';  that was, to  his mind, a  wrong  and unthinkable attitude to adopt  (unthinking?).

It seems unthinkable that a new  commander for  South  Africa should  have been appointed without prior   consultation with the Com- mander in  Chief,  and nothing shows the government's  fear of Wolseley better than that they not only thought of the unthinkable but actually did it.  /  The Kennedy administration has dared to think about the unthinkable and has persuaded  itself  that nuclear war can be used  as an instrument  of  foreign  policy.  / The history of multi-racial  progress since  the war is essentially the story of the reluctant accepting the unthinkable.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 down,"from the coast. But two special uses are  worth  noting. 1.  In relation to London.  The  use  of up  for a journey to London and  down for  one from it preceded the adoption of  those expressions by the railways. Perhaps the idea of accomplishment latent in  up  made it seem the right word for  reaching  the more important place.  Geographical bearing was im- material; going  north  from London was  no  less  down  than going south. 'At  Christmas I  went  down into Scot- land',  wrote  Lord Chancellor Camp- bell in   1846,  'and, crossing the Cheviots, was nearly lost in a  snow- storm.'  'You  don't  mean to say', said  Miss La Creevy,  'that  you are really  going all the way down into Yorkshire this cold winter's weather, Mr. Nickleby.' The railways conformed. They gave the name  up-line  to  that  on which their trains arrived at their London termini and  down-line  to  that  on which they left.  When  a railway was built  without any  direct connexion  with  London the up-line was  that  on which trains ran to the more important terminus. But with  the multiplication of railways, and their linking into a network by junctions, the terms have ceased to have any clear and uniform  signifi- cance,  except  in the case of main lines to and from London. For instance, in one of the routes connecting Edin- burgh and Glasgow, the line on which a  passenger travels from Glasgow is at first  the up-line, for it leads to the more important terminus, Edinburgh, but at a junction where  there  is a con- nexion southwards it becomes the down-line, for on it run trains from London to Edinburgh. Today, when we all use maps, a Lon- doner feels the incongruity of  saying he is going  down  to a place  that  is higher  on the map. He finds it natural enough to say  down  to Brighton or Portsmouth, and he may not jib at down  even for a more northerly place if  its bearing deviates enough from the vertical, Birmingham or  Newmarket for  instance. But he will almost cer- tainly  say  up  to Edinburgh or Aber-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In  relation  to  Oxford  and  Cam- bridge.  To  a  member of these univer- sities  up  means in residence. An under- graduate  goes  up  at the  beginning  of term  and  remains  up  until  he  goes dozvn  at the end of it,  unless  he has the misfortune  to  be sent down earlier. But  this special use relates only  to the universities,  not to the  cities.  An undergraduate will  go  up  (not  down) to London for the day, and his parents visiting  him  from London will  go down  (not  up)  to  see him. upon,  on.

The  choice seems almost wholly  arbitrary, and  there  is no  say- ing  why  one has  taken root  in  some phrases  and  the  other in others :  Upon my  word  but  on my  account;  Kingston upon  Thames  and  Burton upon Trent, but  Henley on Thames  and  Newark on Trent.

In the OED article, published in  1916,  there  is no  hint  of such a use, which was apparently  thought  too illiterate to be even  worth  condemna- tion; nor is  there  in the  1933  Supp. The COD in earlier editions gave ex- amples of it, calling it  'vulg.',  but  with- drew even this amount of recognition in  1964.

"via, via.","In  via  media,  via  is the Latin nominative, and  must  not  have  -â.

There  is no dictionary authority for this use of  viable  in the sense  of passable, as though it came from Latin  via. Viable  is formed from the French  vie: viability  means the capacity of a newly created organism, a  new-born child for instance, or a country becoming independent,  to maintain its separate existence. As VOGUE  WORDS  they  are  having  a won- derful  time.  Nothing  is  durable, workable,  lasting, effective, practicable any  longer :  viable  must  always be the word.  What  is the alternative? I do not pretend  to know the answer, but who can doubt that no viable answer is  possible unless  and until the Commonwealth is strong  and united within itself?  /  A hotel  had been  proposed  for the  Port- man Square site,  but  it was found  that, to  be  economically  viable,  it would have to  be a very  tall  building and would overshadow  the adjacent  square.\  Comedy after all is an assertion of the viability of  private judgement.  In the first of these quotations  no viable answer is possible  seems to be a  pretentious  and obscure way of saying  no alternative will work.  In the second  to be  econo- mically viable  clearly means no more than  what  we used to call  to pay,  but now, it seems,  must  say  to pay off (see  PHRASAL VERBS). In  the   third what  the  writer  meant is anyone's guess. Credible  has lately invaded the field previously held by  viable,  though not with  quite  the same meaning. 'Is it viable?'  means 'Will it work?' 'Is it credible?'  means 'Do people believe that  it will work?' This being its significance,  credible  naturally ap- peared first in company  with  nuclear deterrent;  the all-important question about  a weapon designed not to win a war but to  prevent  one  must  obviously be  whether  a potential enemy believes that  it will work.

virement,"682 vision virement is a French word intro- duced into  England  by  British  Treasury officials  early in the 20th c. In France it had dubious associations  with  finan- cial  sharp practice, but  with  us it is wholly  respectable;  it has become a standard  term  of British public  finance meaning  a government department's duly  authorized use of money for a purpose other than  that  for which it was  voted by parliament. The word is naturalized enough to be no longer italicized  in official documents, but not yet enough to have shed its French pronunciation; the fully anglicized vïrmënt   is, however, increasingly heard and will no  doubt  prevail. The back-formation verb  vire,  freely used orally  but not  yet  considered proper to be set down in  print,  is always pronounced to rhyme  with  wire. virile.  The accent is always on the first  syllable,  but the pronunciation of both  i's  has varied between f and  f  ; OED  puts  first  vï'rïl  and this is now usual  in Britain (U.S.  viril).  See -ÎLE.  The proper sense is  'having  the qualities  of a male adult', but the emphasis  is on  mo/e,  and, though vigorous  can often be substituted for  v. without  affecting the required mean- ing,  v.  must not be substituted for vigorous  where the notion male is out of  place, as  in  :  VIRILE AT 93: Despite her  great  age, Mrs.  Jones  is fairly  virile, and  performs  all her own  household  work.

Of the two forms of  the rank-name,  viscounty  and  vis- countcy,  the first is  both  much older and  of  better  formation. visé  (vë'zd),  in French a p.p.  = 'examined'  or 'endorsed', was formerly used in  English  for what is done to passports— visés,  visé  d,  viséing.  It has now been replaced by the French noun  visa  for all  purposes— visas, visa'd,  visaing. visibility,  visibleness. See  -TY AND -NESS.  The second was formerly in more frequent use than most  -ness words  with  predominant partners in -ty.  The modern use of  visibility  to mean the effect of the weather on the power of seeing things at a distance might have been expected to establish a  useful differentiation.  But  it  has  not; the result has been  that  the more familiar  word is driving  visibleness  out. visible,  visual.  Visible  means cap- able  of being seen;  visual  means per- taining  to seeing. The visual arts are concerned  with  the production of the beautiful in visible form, visually appreciated. This differentiation is sometimes obscured by the misuse of visual  for  visible,  for which indeed dictionary  authority can be found. But the differentiation is  worth  preserving. For  instance the wrong word is used in  the descriptive phrase  Diagnosis  by visual  symptoms',  the method of  diag- nosis  is visual, but the symptoms are visible. vision,  in the sense of statesmanlike foresight  or political  sagacity,  enjoyed a  noticeable vogue some years ago. 'Where there is no vision the people perish' (Prov. xxix.  18)  is perhaps what makes the word tempting to politicians  who wish to be mys- teriously  impressive; at any rate they are  much given to imputing lack of  v. to their opponents and implying possession  of it by themselves when they are at a  loss  for more definite matter.

 words.,"Every now and  then a  word emerges from obscurity, or even from nothingness or a merely potential and not actual existence, into sudden popularity. It is often, but not necessarily, one  that  by no means explains itself to the average man, who has to find out its meaning as  best he can. His wrestlings  with it have usually some effect  upon  it; it does not mean  quite  what  it ought to, but to make up for  that  it means some  things  that  it ought not to, by the  time  he has done  with  it. (See also SLIPSHOD  EXTENSIONS.)  Ready  accep- tance of vogue words seems to some people the  sign  of an alert mind; to others it stands for the herd instinct and lack of individuality. The  title of  this article is perhaps enough to show  that  the second view is here taken; on the whole, the  better  the writer,  or at  any  rate the sounder his style,  the  less  will he be found to in- dulge in the vogue word. It is un- necessary  here to discuss in detail the specimens  that  will be given ; many of them  are to be found in  their  diction- ary  places, and they will here be roughly  classified only. The reason for collecting  them  under a common head- ing  is  that  young writers may not even be aware,  about  some of  them,  that their  loose use is corrupting the voca- bulary, and  that  when  they are not chosen as significant words  but gatecrash  as  CLICHÉS  they are re- pulsive to the old and the well-read. Many,  it should be  added—perhaps most—are  vogue words in particular senses  only, and are unobjectionable, though liable now to ambiguity, in the senses  that  belonged to  them  before they attained  their  vogue. 1.

vulgarization,"receiving  from  it the  dignity  that  was proper  to  them.  Things  are now so different  that  the  elevated style shuns them  as tawdry  ornament  ;  it  says  what the man  in the  street  says,  before  and  ex- cept,  and  leaves  ere  and  save  to  those writers who have  not yet  ceased  to  find them  beautiful—which  is naturally con- fusing,  and an  injury  to the  language. The fate  of  awful  (see  TERRIBLY)  is of rather earlier date,  but is  still  re- membered, and  weird  and  ghastly  have, almost  in our own  century, been robbed  of all  their weirdness  and ghastliness.  There  is  little  in  common between  the  LYRICS  of  Pindar  and those  of a  modern 'musical',  or be- tween  the  cartoons  of  Raphael  and the strip variety  of our  popular press,  or between  the  SATIRES  of  Juvenal  and much  of  what  goes  by  that  name  to- day,  or  between  the  SAGA  of  Grettir the Strong  and  that  of  Flook.  One would like  to  represent  to the  gossip writers  and  advertisers  that  they  are desecrating  the  words  EPIC,  glamorous, and  FABULOUS  by  applying  them  to cocktail parties, cosmetics,  and  strip- tease  girls  ; but  they would probably be  as  indignant  at the  notion  that  their touch  pollutes  as the  writer  would  be who  was  told  that  he was  injuring faerie  and  evanish  and  mystic  and optimistic  and  unthinkable  and  replica by selecting  them  in  honourable preference  to  fairy  and  vanish  and mysterious  and  hopeful  and  incredible and  copy.  Vulgarization  of  words  that should  not be in  common  use  robs some  of  their aroma, others  of  their substance, others  again  of  their precision;  but  nobody likes  to be  told that  the  best service  he can do to a  favourite word  is to  leave  it  alone, and perhaps  the  less  said here  on  this matter  the  better.

To  waive  is not a derivative, confined  to  certain senses, of  to  wave,  but a  derivative  of  waif, meaning  to  make waif  or  abandon.

walled-up object.,"/  shut  and locked him in  is permissible  English;  /  scolded and sent him to bed  is not.  In  the first, in  is common  to  shut  and  locked; him  is therefore not walled up  between  locked and  a  word  that  is the private  property of  locked.  In the  second,  to  bed  is peculiar  to  sent,  and therefore  him,  en- closed  between  sent  and  sent's  appur- tenance  to bed,  is not available as object to  scolded;  it is  necessary  to say / scolded  him and sent him to bed,  though /  scolded  and  punished  him  requires only  one  him.  If it is  said  that  the agitated disciplinarian cannot  be ex- pected  to  decide when  her  boy  is two kirns,  and when not,  the  plea may  at once  be  admitted.  It is not in  hasty colloquial  use  that  such lapses  are wicked, and the examples chosen were the simplest possible  in  order  that  the grammatical  point  might  be  unmis- takable.  But in  print  it is  another matter.  The  string  of  quotations fol- lowing  shows how common this sloven- liness  is, and  no  more need  be  said  of them  than  that  for nearly all the cure  is to release  the  walled-up words, place them  as  object  to the  unencumbered verb (which usually comes first),  and fill  their  now  empty  place  with  a pronoun,  it,  them,  etc.  ;  this  is  done  in brackets after  the  first quotation, and any  change  not  according  to  this simple formula is shown for later ones  : An earnest agitation for increasing and rendering  that  force  more  efficient (read  for  increasing that  force  and rendering  it  . .  .)./  It  is  for its  spirited reconstructions  of  various marches and battles that  we  counsel  the reader to buy and make  the book  his own.  / /  hope  the Ministry will also avail  itself  of the same  effective machinery  if  not  to re- form,  then  to  make  the  Church  of England  a  free   Church  in a  free country.  /  He  had to count, trim,  press, and pack  the  furs  into bales  (read  and press  the furs, and pack  them;  or, of course,  the  omission  of  into bales would  put all  right).  /  They  had definitely beaten  and  knocked  one of their opponents  out of the  war.  /  A season  in  Opposition will invigorate and restore  them  to  health  (read  invigorate",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

As Wardour Street  itself  offered to those who lived in modern houses the opportunity of picking up an antique or two  that  might be con- spicuous for good or ill among their surroundings,  so this article offers to those who  write  modern English a selection of oddments calculated to establish (in the eyes of some readers) their claim to be persons of taste and writers  of  beautiful  English.

It is  time  for  someone to come  to the  rescue  of the  phrase as well  as,  which  is  being cruelly treated.   Grammatically,  the  point is  that  as  well  as  is a  conjunction  and not  a  preposition.  Or, to put it in a  less  abstract way,  its  strict meaning is  not  besides,  but  and not  only.

The  abuses occur, however, not  in  simple sentences like this  with a  common noun  or  pronoun following as well  as.

The danger  of  wrong hyphens  is  greater than  that  of  wrong separation;  e.g. to write  His  courage  is  well-knovm (where  well known  is the  only tolerable form)  is  much worse than  to  write  His well  known  courage,  which, though  un- usual,  is  justifiable. Some help will be found under  HYPHENS;  and  it  maybe here repeated  that  if a  participle  with well  is  attributive  (a  well-aimed  stroke) the hyphen  is  often  used,  though  not necessary;",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 but,"if the  participle  is pre- dicative  (the  stroke  was  well  aimed)  the hyphen  is  wrong.  Similarly  in  such phrases  as  well  off:  They  are  not  well  off, but  Well-off  people  cannot  judge.  These are  not  arbitrary rules; they follow from acceptance  of the  principle  that hyphens should  not be  used except when  a  reader needs their help.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

what,"is a word of peculiar interest, because  the small problems  that  it poses  for writers are such as on the one hand yield pretty readily to  analy- sis,  and on the other hand demand a slightly  more expert  analysis  than they are  likely to get from those who think they can write well enough without stopping to learn grammar. 1.  Wrong number attraction.  2. What  singular  and  what  plural.  3.  One what  in two  cases.  4.  What  resumed by  {and, but) which.  5. Miscellaneous. 1.  Wrong number attraction.  In each  of the examples to be  given  it is  beyond question  that  what  starts as a  singular  pronoun  (=  that  which, or a  thing that), because a  singular  verb follows  it; but in each  also  the next verb,  belonging to the  that  of  that which,  or to the  a thing  of  a thing that, is  not  singular  but plural. This is due to the influence of a complement in the plural,  and the grammatical name for such  influence is  attraction',  all the quotations are on the pattern  What is said  are  words,  instead of  What is said is  words.  Whether attraction of verb to complement is idiomatic in Eng- lish  has already been discussed in NUMBER  1;  it is here assumed  that  it is  not, and  that  therefore in the quota- tions  that  follow, if the  singular  is  is to stand  (as to which see below), the roman-type verb should have its number  changed from  plural to singular:  What is of  absorbing  and permanent  interest  are  the  strange metamorphoses  which this fear under- went.  I  What is  required  are  houses at  rents  that the  people  can  pay.  j  What is  required  are  three  bedrooms,  a  good large  living-room  . . . /  What is wanted to  meet it  are  proposals  which  are  practi- cal.  I  What is  needed  are  a  few  recognized British  financial  corporations,  j  What is of  more  importance  in the  official statement  of  profits  are  the  following figures. 2.  What  singular  and  what  plural. In each  of the above quotations, the writer made it plain,  by  giving  what a  singular  verb,  that  he conceived what  there as a  singular  pronoun. But  the word  itself  can equally well be plural  :  /  have few  books,  and what there  are do  not help me.  So  arises",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
what,"another problem concerning  the num- ber  of  verbs after  what,  and  this second  one  naturally gets mixed  up with  the  first,  in  which some  of the examples could  be  mended  as  well  by giving  what  a  plural verb  as by  giving the complement  a  singular  one. In dealing  with  this other problem,  how- ever,  we  will ignore  the  complication that  the  number  of a  verb  may be affected  by the  'attraction'  of the complement,  and  consider only  the question when  a  verb governed  by what  should  be  treated  a  singular  and when  as  plural. First  comes  a  particular form  of sentence  in  which plural  what  is better  than singular,  or in  other words in  which  its  verb should  be  plural. These  are  sentences  in  which  what,  if resolved,  comes  out as  the   s  that, s  standing  for a  plural noun actu- ally  present  in the  complement. After each  quotation  a  correction  is  first given  if it is  desirable,  and in any  case the resolution  that  justifies  the  plural  : We have been invited  to  abandon what seems  to us to be the  most valuable parts  of our  Constitution  (read  seem; abandon  the  parts  of our  Constitution that  seem).  /  The  Manchester  City Council,  for  what  was  doubtless  good and sufficient  reasons,  decided  not to take  any  part  (read  were;  for  reasons that  were).  /  It is a  diatribe against  M. Loucheur  and M.  Clementel,  but the personal  aspect  is of  little  importance  to English  readers;  what  are  important  are the  criticisms  of  the  operation  of  protec- tive  duties  in  France  (The  criticisms that;  but  What  is  important  is  would have  been  better,  what  is  standing  for the  thing that  is,  in  contrast  with aspect).  I  They specially  approved  what to  Liberals  was  the  most reactionary and disastrous parts  of it  (read  were; approved  the  parts of it  that  to  Liberals were).  /  Confidence  being  inspired  by the production  of  what  appears  to  be bars  or bricks  of  solid  gold  (read  appear;  pro- duction  of  bars  or  bricks  that  appear). But  resolution  of  what  often  pre- sents  us not  with  a  noun found  in the complement,  but  with  some other noun  of  wider meaning,  or  again  with 692",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
 ,,Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
what,"the still vaguer  that which.  A  writer should make  the  resolution  and act on it  without  allowing  the  number  of the complement  to  force  a  plural verb  on him  if the  most natural representative of  what  is  that which  or  the  thing that. In  several  of the  following quotations the necessary courage  has  been lack- ing;  corrections  and  resolutions  are given  as before :  No  other  speaker  has  his peculiar  power  of  bringing  imagination to  play  on  what  seems,  until  he  speaks, to  be  familiar platitudes  (read  seem;  on sayings  that  seem)./  Instead  of  the  stupid agitation  now  going  on in  South Wales, what  are  needed  are  regular  working  and higher  outputs  (read  what  is  needed  is; the thing  that  is  needed—rather  than things,  as opp.  agitation).  /  What  are wanted  are  not  small  cottages,  but the larger  houses  with modern  conveniences that  are  now demanded  by the  working classes  (read  what is wanted is;  the  thing that  is  wanted—rather  than  the  build- ings  that  are).  /  What  provoke  men's curiosity  are  mysteries,  mysteries  of  mo- tive  or  stratagem; astute or  daring  plots (read  provokes  . . . is;  that  which  pro- vokes—rather  than  the  things  that  pro- voke),  j  Inorder  to  reduce  this material to  utility  and  assimilate  it,  what  are  re- quired  are  faith  and  confidence,  and willingness  to  work  (read  what is  required is;  but the  qualities  that  are  required justifies  the  plurals, though  it  does  not make  them  idiomatic). It will  be  observed  that  there  is  more room  for  difference  of  opinion  on  this set  of  examples than  on  either those  in 1  or the  previous  set in  2,  and  probably many  readers will refuse  to  accept  the decisions  given;  but if it is  realized that  there  are  problems  of  number after  what,  and  that  solutions  of  them are  possible,  that  is  sufficient. 3.  One  what  in two  cases.  For the general  question whether  in a lan- guage  that,  like  English,  has shed nearly all  its  case-forms  the  grammatical notion  of  case still  deserves  respect, see  CASES  3D.  It is  here assumed  that it does,  to the  extent  that  no  word, even if  it has not  different forms such  as / and  me  for the  subjective  and  objective uses,  ought  to be so  placed  that  it  has,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
what,"without  being repeated, to be taken twice over, first in one and then in the other  case.  The word  what  is pecu- liarly  liable to such  treatment.  There are  two chief ways of sparing gram- matically-minded readers this outrage on their susceptibilities: sometimes a second  what  should be inserted ; some- times it is  better  to convert a verb to the other voice, so  that  what  becomes either object, or subject, to  both.  Cor- rections are given in  brackets;  to cor- rect Pater, from  whom  the last example comes,  is perhaps impudence, but grammar  is no respecter of persons: This is  pure  ignorance  of what the House  is  and its  work  consists  of  (and what its). /  But it is not folly to  give  it what  it had for  centuries  and was only artificially  taken from it  by  force  rather more  than a hundred years ago  (what belonged  to it for). /  Mr.   tells us not  to  worry  about  Relativity  or  anything so  brain-tangling,  but to  concentrate  on what surrounds us,  and we  can weigh and  measure  (and can be weighed and measured).  /  Impossible  to  separate  later legend  from  original  evidence  as to what he  was,  and said, and  how he said it (and what he  said). 4.  What  resumed by  and which  or but which.  Francis  Turner  Palgrave, whose  name is inseparably  connected with what is probably the best,  and which  certainly has  proved  the most popular,  of  English  anthologies  (what is probably the best, and has certainly proved).  /  It is an instructive con- spectus  of views on what can hardly be described  as a  'burning  question',  but which  certainly  interests  many Irishmen (but certainly interests). /  We are merely  remembering  what  happened  to  our arboreal  ancestors,  and which  has been stamped  by  cerebral  changes  into the heredity  of the  race  (and has been stamped). A want of faith either in the staying  power of  what  (which has a good  second wind and can do the two laps  without  turning a  hair),  or in the reader's  possession of common sense, has  led to this thrusting in of  which  as a sort of relay to take up the running. These sentences are not  English; nothing can represent  what —except indeed  what.  That is to say, it would be  English,  though hardly idiomatic English,  to insert a second  what  in the place  of the impossible  which  in each. If  the reader will try the effect, he will find  that  the second  what,  though permissible,  sometimes makes am- biguous  what  without  it is plain; in the last example, for instance, 'what happened' and 'what has been stamped' might be different things, whereas 'what happened, and has been stamped' is  clearly one and the same thing. The reason  why  which  has been called 'im- possible'  is  that  what  and  which  are of different grammatical values,  which being  a simple relative pronoun, while what  (  —  that  which, or a thing that) is  a combination of antecedent and relative.  The second verb needs the antecedent-relative just as much as the first,  if  but  or  and  is inserted; if neither but  nor  and  is present,  which  will some- times be possible, and so omission of and  would be another cure for the last  example. Two specimens are added in which the remedy of simply omitting  which or substituting for it a repeated  what is  not possible  without  further change. The difficulty is due to the supersti- tion against  PREPOSITION  AT  END,  and vanishes  with  it. /  can never be certain that I am  receiving  what I  zuant  and for which /  am paying.  Read  what I want and am paying for.  /  But now we have a  Privy  Councillor  and an ex-Minister engaged  daily in saying and doing zvhat he  frankly admits is illegal,  and for which  he  could  be  severely  punished. Read  and what he  could  be  severely punished  fo~.  The repetition of  what is  required because the relative con- tained in the first  what  is subjective, and  that  in the second objective; see 3. 5.  Miscellaneous. Some writers  with an  excessive zeal for correctness seem to think  that  what  is inelegant and  that which  is an improvement on it. But hold  fast to that which is  good  is no better  English  than  holdfast  to what is good;  in fact the first has now a slightly  old-fashioned air.

What ever  in this use is an emphatic form of  what  as antecedent-relative (see WHAT);  i.e., while  what  means  that which or the (thing, things)  ih&t,what- ever  means all  that  or any(thing etc.) that.  The point ignored in the quota- tions below is  that,  since  whatever contains  in itself the relative  (that  or which)  as well as the demonstrative or antecedent  (all, any,  etc.),  another relative  cannot grammatically be in- serted after it;  whatever  (or  whatsoever) means  not  any,  but  any that,  and whatever  that  is as absurd as  any that that.

They differ from the whatever  clauses dealt  with  above in being  adverbial,  whatever  meaning not all  or  any that (that  beginning an adjectival  clause),  but  though  all  ox  any. The difference is not a matter of  hair- splitting;  Whatever he has done he re- pents  may mean (a) He is  one  of the irresolute people who always wish they had done something different, or (b) Though he may be a great offender, repentance should count for some- thing;  whatever  antecedent-relative gives  (a) and  whatever  concessive  gives (b).

In A the  grammar  is  unexcep- tionable,  which  being  the  object  of have beaten,  and  having  no  second  job as  a  pronoun (though  as  relative  it attaches  to  Bogey  the  clause  that  is also  attached  by  if  to  you  are  etc.).  In modern  use,  however, this arrange- ment  is  rare, being usually changed  to 'if  you  have beaten which'.  In B we come  to  questionable grammar,  which being object first  to  have beaten  and then  to  mention',  English  that  is  both easy  and  educated usually avoids this by making  which  object only  to  men- tion,  and  providing  have beaten  with another— which,  if  you have beaten  it, you  are apt to  mention.

In the  first, which  is the  easier  to deal  with,  it  will  be  noticed  that  in sense  the  third  part  (and  was  to the  end) is  clearly coupled  by  and  not to the first  part  or  main sentence  (He  shows to  practices),  but to the  second  part  or relative clause  (in  some  to  indulged).

The other example  {It  imposes  a  prob- lem which we either  solve  or  perish)  is, owing  to Lord Grey's 'The nations must learn or perish', of a now very popular pattern. The break-away de- pends on the nature of  either . . . or alternatives,  in which whatever stands before  either  must be common to  both the  either  and the  or  groups.  Either  we solve  this or we  perish  can therefore become  We either  solve  this or  perish, but cannot become  This we either  solve or  perish,  because  this  is peculiar to the either  group—otherwise  the full form would be  Either  we  solve  this or we perish  this.  With  this  as object the escape  is  easy—to  put  this  after  solve —;  with  which  as object  that  is not tolerable  (we either  solve  which or perish),  and strict grammar requires us to introduce into the  or  group some- thing  that  can take  which  as  object— a problem  which we either  solve  or  perish by not  solving,  either  solve  or are destroyed  by,  etc. Even those who ordinarily  are prepared to treat  either with  proper respect (see  EITHER  5) may perhaps allow themselves the popular form;  if not,  'A  problem which if we do not solve we perish' (see 3 A) is worth  considering. 5.  Confused construction.  He may be  expected  to make a determined bid for  the dual  rôle  which  is his  right  and duty as  Prime  Minister to  occupy.  In that  sentence, is  which  subject to  is, or object to  occupy}  It is in fact, of course,  the latter,  occupy  having no other object, and not being able to do  without  one; but the writer has effectually  put us off the track by dropping the  it  that  should have parted  which  from  is. To  occupy  which is his  right  becomes, when  which  is given  its normal place,  which it is his right  to  occupy.  This mistake is very common, and will be found fully dis- cussed  under IT  I. 6. Late position. In the examples, which are arranged as a climax, the distance  between  which  and its ante- cedent is shown  by  the roman type. Grammar has nothing to say on the subject, but common sense protests against  abuse of  this  freedom.  She is wonderful  in her brilliant  sketch  of that querulous,  foolish  little old lady  which she  does  so  well,  j The  whole  art of clinching  is explained in this little  book from  the  concentrated  harvest of  wisdom in  which  we  present  some  specimens  to our  readers.  /  Nothing has  more  con- tributed  to  dispelling  this illusion than the  camera,  the remarkable and con- vincing  evidence  it has  been  possible  to obtain  with  which  has  enormously added  to the  knowledge  of the habits of animals. 7.  Commas. The plea is made  else- where in this book  (THAT,  REL.  I; WHICH,  THAT,  WHO, 9)  that  defining and  non-defining  relative  clauses  ought to be readily distinguishable by the use  of  that  for the former and of which  etc. for the latter. But since most writers continue to use  which  for both  it is important to have another means  of distinguishing. A comma preceding  which  shows  that  the  which- clause  is non-defining, and the absence of  such a comma shows  that  it is defin- ing.  He  declares  that the men  were treated  like  beasts  throughout  the  voyage, and  he  gives  the  worst  description  of  the general  mismanagement  which  was  most conspicuous.  There is no comma before which,  and therefore the clause must be presumed to be a  denning  one; i.e., it limits the sense of  the  general  mis- management  by excluding from it such parts as were  less  conspicuous; the most conspicuous part of the mis- management  is  described  as very bad indeed—that  is what we are told. Or is  it not so, and are we to understand rather  that  the whole of the general mismanagement  is described as very bad, and moreover  that  it was con- spicuous?  Surely the latter is meant; but the absence of the comma forbids us  to take it so. The difference between the two  senses  (or the sense and the nonsense)  is not here of great impor-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

That  right  interpretation should depend on a mere comma is a pity, but, until  that  and  which  are differentiated, so it must be, and writers must see their commas  safely through the press. 8.

No one need hesitate about  going  back to nature and  saying to  buy  food  with.  And even for the first 'the last country to say so in' is here recommended, though the very light word  so  happens to make  with  the other very light word  in  an uncom- fortably  weak ending; much more is 'a  good land to live in' superior to 'a good  land in which to live'. A con- fessedly  amateur  guess  at the  genesis of  these constructions may possibly throw light. The assumption under- lying  the  in which to  form is obviously that  there is an elliptical relative clause —'This  is a good land in which (one is) to live'. The amateur  guess  is  that  there is  no relative clause in the case at all, and  that  the form  to live in  originated in  an adverbial infinitive attached to the adjective  good.  He is a hard man to beat; how hard? why, to beat; what Greek grammars call an epexegetic (or explanatory) infinitive.  It is a  good land to in-habit  is precisely parallel, and  to live-in  is precisely the same as to  in-habit.  If this  account  is true, the unpleasant form 'in which to live' might be dismissed as a grammarians' mistaken pedantry.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

If the evidence of  a  first- class  writer who was no purist or pedant counts for anything, Lord Morley's  opinion exhibited below should make it  worth  while  to master the differences between  which  and the other relatives. The extracts are from an  article in the  Westminster Gazette of  3rd  Oct.  1923  by Miss  Hulda Friedrichs:  'In  1920  Messrs.  Macmil- lan  published a new edition of Lord Morley's  works ... He  was  determined to make it a carefully revised edition, and  made one or two  attempts  at revis- ing  it himself. . . . He then asked me whether I would care to help him, and  explained what my part of the work would be. It sounded rather dull,  for he was particularly keen on having  the word  which,  wherever there was  the possibility, exchanged for  that. .  . . He was always ready and very willing  to go  with  me through the notes I had jotted down while  going through a book page by page, ""which"" hunting and looking out for other errors.' Let it be stated broadly, before com- ing  to particular dangers,  that:  (A) of which  and  that, which  is appropriate to non-defining  and  that  to defining clauses;  (B) of  which  and  who, which belongs  to things, and  who  to persons; (C) of  who  and  that, who  suits particu- lar  persons, and  that  generic persons. (A)  The river, which  here  is tidal, is dangerous,  but  The river that flows through  London is the Thames.  (B)  The crews,  which  consisted  of  Lascars,  muti- nied,  but  Six  Welshmen,  who  formed  the crew,  were  drowned.  (C)  You who are a walking  dictionary,  but  He is a man that is never at a  loss.  To substitute for the relative used in any of those six examples either of the others, if the principles maintained in this book are correct, would be a change for the worse;  and, roughly speaking, the erroneous uses (if they are so)  illus- trated below are traceable to neglect or rejection of A, B, and C. 2.

Which  after superlative  etc.  When the antecedent  of a  defining clause includes  a  word  of  exclusive meaning, such  as a  superlative,  an  ordinal numeral,  or 'the few', the use of  which instead  of  that  (or  who  as  second best) is  bad  enough  to be  almost  a  solecism even  in the  present undiscriminating practice.  The  question between  that and  who  in  such places will  be  touched upon  in  para.  9; but at  least  which should  be  expelled from  the  following extracts.

I was sur- prised many years  ago  when  a  very well-known writer  gave  me his  notion of  the  relation between  which  and  that: When  it  struck  him  that  there  was  too much  which  about,  he  resorted  to  that for  a  relief.  So he  said;  it was  doubt- less  only  a  flippant evasion,  not a truthful  account  of his own  practice, but still  a  tacit confession  that  he fol- lowed instinct  without  bothering about principles.  Of the  unskilled writer's method  it  would  be a  true  enough account; here  is a  specimen:  Govern- ments  find  themselves  almost  compelled by  previous  and  ill-informed  pledges  to do  things  which  are  unwise  and to refrain from  doing things  that  are  necessary. The  two  relative clauses  are  exactly parallel,  and the  change from  which  to that  is  ELEGANT  VARIATION  at its worst. When  two  relative clauses  are not parallel,  but one of  them  depends  on the other,  it is not  such  a  simple  mat- ter;  as is  stated  in  REPETITION  (Depen-",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

 who,"7 01 dent  Sequences),  there  is a  reasonable objection  to one  which-clause,  or one r/iar-clause,  depending  on  another. Two examples will show  the  effect  (a) of  scorning consequences  and  risking repetition,  and (b) of  trying elegant variation;  neither   is  satisfactory: (a)  Surely  the  reductio  ad  absurdum  of tariffs is found  in a  German treaty with Switzerland  which  contains  a  clause which  deserves  to  remain famous;  (b) The task  is to  evolve  an  effective system that  shall  not  imperil  the  self-governing principle  which  is the  corner-stone  of the  Empire.  The  repetition  is  easily avoided  in (a) by the  change  of  which contains  to  containing {which  in  both places  ought  to  have been  that,  but that  is  here irrelevant).  In (b) the absence  of a  comma shows  that  the which  is  meant  as a  denning  relative and should therefore  be  that;  but, as a non-defining clause would here give a  hardly distinguishable sense,  the escape  is to use one and  keep  which, merely inserting  the  necessary  com- ma.  The  reader  may  like another  ex- ample  to  play  with:  . . .  was  recalled to  the  passer-by  in  Pall-Mall  by  Foley's fine  bronze  statue  of the War  Minister who  deeply  cared  for the  private soldier,  which  stood  in front  of  the now destroyed  War  Office,  that  has  very recently  given place  to the  palatial premises  of  the Royal Automobile Club. 7.  That  for  which.  After  all  these intrusions  of  which  into  the  place  of that,  it  must  be  recorded  that  retalia- tion  is not  quite  unknown;  but it is rare.  In the  island  of  South Uist, that I  have  come  from, there  is not  one single tree.  /  A  really happy party  was the Chiver  ton  family, that had  a  carriage  to itself  and almost filled  it.

Three examples  that accordingly  need correction are :  There was  a  strong  section  which were  in favour  of  inserting  the  miners'  $s. and 2s.,  as the  debate  proved  (which  is re- quired  by  the  preceding  was,  but in turn  requires  a  second  was  instead  of were).  /  All the  world  who is  directly interested  in  railway  projects  will have paid  a  visit  to the  Brussels  Exhibition (who  is  possible,  but  only  if  are  fol- lows;  otherwise  not  indeed  which since  the  clause  is  defining,  but  that is  required).  /  The  Canon  is  writing  in justification  of the  Christian  Social Union,  which,  he  tells  us,  are  tired  of the  present  state  of  things (which  is,  or who  are, tired). 9.  Who  and  that.  It  would  be  satis- factory  if the  same clear division  of functions  that  can be  confidently  re- commended  for  that  and  which,  viz. between  defining  and  non-defining clauses,  could  be  established also  for that  and  who;  this would give  us  that for  all  denning  clauses  whether  quali- fying  persons  or  things,  and  who  for persons  but  which  for  things  in all non-defining.

 and or but.,"It is  well known  that  and which  and  but which are  kittle  cattle, so well known  that the more timid writers avoid the dangers  associated  with  them  by keep- ing  clear of  them  altogether—a  method that  may be inglorious, but is effectual and usually not difficult. Others,  less pusillanimous or more ignorant, put their  trust  in a rule  of  thumb  and take the risks.  That  rule is  that  and which or  but which  should be used only if another  which  has preceded. It is not true;  and-which  clauses may be legiti- mate  without  a preceding  which,  and its natural though  illogical  corollary— that  and which  is always legitimate if another  which  has  preceded—induces a  false security  that  begets many blun- ders.  On the other hand, it probably saves  many more bad  and-whichs  than it  produces.  Anyone who  asks  no  more of  a rule of  thumb  than  that  it should save  him the trouble of working out his  problems separately, and take him right more often than it takes him wrong, should abandon the present article at this  point. Those for whom such a rule is not good  enough may be encouraged to proceed by a few sentences in which it has not averted disaster:  A  special measure  of  support  and sympathy  should be  extended to the  Navy  and Admiralty, which  have certainly never  been  more  in need  of it,  and  to which  they have  never been  more  entitled than today.  /  After a search  for  several  days he found a firm which  had a  large  quantity of them  and which  they had no  use  for.} A  period  in which  at times the most  ungenerous ideas and the most  ignoble  aims have strutted  across  the  stage,  and which  have promptly  been  exploited by  unscrupulous journalists  and politicians.  True, it is easy  to see the  flaw  in all these, viz. that  the two  whichs  have not the same antecedent, and to say  that  common sense  is to be expected of those who apply rules  ;  but  then  rules of  thumb are meant just for those who have not enough common sense to do  without them,  and ought to be made foolproof. Here, on the other hand, are ex- amples in which  there  is no preceding which,  and yet  and  (or  but) which  is blameless:  Mandates issued, which the member  is bound blindly and implicitly to  obey, to vote and to  argue  for, though contrary  to the  clearest  conviction  of his judgment  and  conscience — these  are things  utterly unknown to the laws of this land, and which  arise  from  a  funda- mental mistake of the whole  order  and tenor  of our Constitution  (Burke). /  An- other  natural  prejudice,  of most  exten- sive  prevalence, and which  had a  great share  in  producing  the  errors  fallen into by the  ancients  in  their  physical  inquiries, was this  (J.

which with and or but,"the  early evening a few weeks  since,  has now  reappeared. The  first  of these is from Burke, the second from Mill, and the other two from the most ordinary modern  writ- ing.  Supporters of the rule of  thumb will find it more  difficult  to appeal here to common sense, and will perhaps say instead  that,  no  matter  who  wrote them,  they are wrong. It will be main- tained below  that  they are right. The rule of  thumb  fails,  as such rules are apt to do, for want of essential quali- fications or exceptions. The first quali- fication needed is  that  the  which  that has  preceded must belong to the same antecedent as the one  that  is to be attached by  and  or  bin;  our set of wrong examples, as we have seen, do not conform to  that  qualification.  The next  amendment is  both  more  im- portant  and, to the lovers of simple easy  rules, more discouraging: the 'another  which'  that  was to be the  test must be understood as meaning  'a clause  or expression of the same gram- matical value as the coming  which- clause'.  Now  what  is of the same gram- matical value as  a  which~clau.se  is either another  which-clause  or its equivalent, and its equivalent may be an adjective or participle  with  its belongings (utterly  unknown to the laws of this land,  discovered  by Mr. B. in the summer),  or an adjectival phrase  (of most  extensive  prevalence;  within the London  area);  for  before these  there might be inserted  which are, which  was, etc.,  without  any effect on the mean- ing.  And, secondly,  what  is of the same grammatical value as the  which-clause that  is coming must be an expression that  agrees  with  it in being of the defining,  or of the non-defining, kind; i.e.,  two defining expressions may be linked by  and  or  but,  and so may two non-defining, but a  denning  and a non- defining  must not. A defining expression is one  that  is inserted for  the  purpose of enabling the  reader  to identify the thing to which it is attached by answering about it such questions as  which   ?,  what ?,  what  sort  of   ? If the Burke  quotation had stopped short at things  (Mandates . . . are things.),  we should have  said  No  doubt  they are things,  but  what  sort of things? We cannot tell  what  sort of things Burke has  in mind till the expressions mean- ing  'unknown to  law'  and 'arising from mistake' identify  them  for us. Both expressions are therefore of the defin- ing  kind, and legitimately linked by and;  whether  which  occurs in  both,  or only  in one, is of no importance. In that  example  there  can, owing to the vagueness  of the antecedent  things,  be no sort of  doubt  that  the expressions are defining.  Often  there  is no such comfortable certainty. In the Mill sentence, for instance, 'another natural prejudice' is not a vague description like  things,  demanding definition be- fore we know where we are  with  it. If the sentence had run simply  Another natural  prejudice  was this,  we should not have suspected a lacuna. We can- not be sure  whether  the two expres- sions  were defining, meaning  Another natural, widespread, and fatal pre- judice  was this,  or  non-defining, meaning  Another natural  prejudice — and it was a  widespread  and fatal  one-— was this.  It is clear, however,  that, whether  'of most extensive prevalence' is  defining or  non-defining,  'which had a  great share' is the same, and the  and which  is legitimate. It was because it is not always possible to say  whether clauses  and expressions of the kind we are considering are defining or non- defining  that  the phrase 'inserted for the purpose of enabling the reader to identify' was so worded; the difference is  often, though not always, a  matter  of the writer's intention. After these explanations the rule, as now amended, can be set down :  And which  or  but which  should not be used unless  the coming  zy/nc/z-clause  has been preceded by a clause or expres- sion  of the same grammatical value as itself. And a reasonable addition to this is the warning  that,  though the linking  of a relative clause to a really parallel  expression  that  is not a rela- tive clause is  logically  and gram- matically  permissible, it has often an ungainly  effect and is not unlikely to",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

In  what  follows, which will consist largely  of  bad  and-which  or but-which  clauses  with  corrections,  the assumption will  be, on the  contrary, that  which  and  that  are,  with  some special  exceptions, respectively  the non-defining and the defining relatives.

while,"and  although,  not  with  and  and  or.  The distinction is of some importance to what follows. Nothing, perhaps, is more characteristic of the  flabbier  kind of  journalese than certain uses  oi  while, especially  that  which is described by the OED as 'colourless'; see  (1) below. The proper use of  while  as a strong conjunction may be either temporal (= during the time that) or non-temporal  (=  whereas or though). While she  spoke,  the tears  were  running down  I  While this is true of  some  it is not true  of all.  It  also  admits of ellipsis. While walking on the  road  he  was run over  I  While  convinced  you are  wrong  I am  sure  you are  sincere.  But writers are  often  tempted  into incorrect ellipsis  of two kinds (a) disregard of the full form,  (b)  wrongly attached participle. Examples of (a) are:  But while  being  in  agreement  with Sir Max Waechter's  main thesis, I am bound to confess  my opinion that he . . .  (the full form is not  while I am  being,  but  while I  am,  which should be used  without ellipsis).  /  We abide by that  generous gesture,  and while  being prepared  to remit  all that our Allies owe  tous  ..  .we ask  only that they should. . .  .  Omit being.  J  An example of (b)  is  :  While willing  to  sincerely  sympathize with those  who would suffer by such an order,  they  can only  console  themselves with the thought how lucky they have been  that the fortunes of war have not affected  them  sooner  (the full form would be not  while they are willing, but  while I am  or  we are willing,  so that  willing  is wrongly attached; read while  we are willing).  / For other examples  see UNATTACHED  PARTICIPLES. The stages of degradation of  while from a strong conjunction to a weak one may be exhibited thus : (1)  Strong conjunction playing the part  of weak, i.e. introducing what is in  grammar a subordinate clause but is  in sense a coordinate sentence; the 'colourless'   use,  =   and: White outfought  Ritchie in nearly every round,  and the latter bled  profusely, while  both his eyes  were  nearly  closed  at the  end.

who and whom,"tive, and English-speakers being very little conversant  with  case-forms, con- fusions  are  sure  to  occur. One  is of importance  as  being extraordinarily common,  and is  taken  by  itself  in Sec.  2; the others can  be  quickly dis- posed  of  here. In talk  who  is constantly used for the objective  case,  especially when  an interrogative  is  governed by  a  verb  or preposition  that  follows  it,  as  in  Who did you meet  there?  Who did you hear that  from?   This colloquialism  is indeed so common  that  it is  invading printed   matter.  When  a  weekly journal, always scrupulous about  its English,  chooses  Who will the Opposi- tion  oppose?  as the  heading  of  an article,  and when  a  book reviewer  in The Times  writes  Who are  such conspectuses  really  for?,   we  must presume the choice to have been made deliberately,  to  avoid any suspicion of pedantry; and,  if a  writer given  to  the VERBLESS  SENTENCES  now so popular writes  Who  from?  as one, his flouting of  grammar will  be  more  in  keeping with  modern idiom than  Whom  from? or  From  whom?  But  who's  invasion of the province of  whom  has not gone  so far  in  indirect questions  as in  direct, and  we  may reasonably suspect such sentences as the following to be due  to carelessness  rather than  a  splendid de- fiance  of  grammar  :  When the  Queen  asks her  retiring  Prime  Minister  about  who  she should  summon  to  head the government he  wants to be able to  offer  her an unequi- vocal  answer.  /  Before  the intrusion of television  into  politics,  politicians knew pretty  well who they  were  speaking  at. The opposite mistake  of""  a  wrong whom  may  sometimes  be  found  in indirect questions, especially when  it is  preceded  by a  transitive verb  or a preposition. Even Henry James could write  He had an air of  being  but vaguely  aware  of  whom Miss Chan- cellor  might  be.  Other  examples: Speculation  is still  rife  as to  whom will captain  the English side  to  Australia./ The  French-Canadian,  who had  learned whom  the visitors  were,  tried to  apolo- gize  to  Prince  Albert.

This practice  is  untidy enough  with  words that,  like  which  and  that,  have only one form for  both  cases (see  CASES  3  p, THAT,  REL. PRON.  5,  WHICH  2),  but is still  worse  with  who  and  whom.  The correct form should  be  inserted  in the second clause when  a  different case is  wanted:  He  ran upstairs and kissed two  children  whom  he  only faintly  re- cognized,  and  yet  were  certainly  his own.  I  But  there  has  emerged  to the final  a  Spaniard,  in  Senor  Alonso, whom  few  people  would have supposed to have  a  good  chance  a  fortnight  ago  but is  delighting  the  advocates  of  the older style  by  the beauty and rhythm  of  his strokes.

who and whom,"have become  whom  by attraction to the case of  Ferdinand;  or by confusion with  another way of  putting  the thing — whom  they  suppose  (to be)  drown'd; or  again  a writer may have a general impression  that,  with  who  and  whom to choose between, it is usually safer to play  whom  except  where an im- mediately following verb decides at once for  who.  Any of these influences may  be at work, but none of  them  can avail  as a defence against the plain fact  that  the relative is the subject of its clause. Nor can Shakespeare's authority  protect  the modern solecist; did not the  Revisers,  in an analogous case,  correct the  whom  of a more familiar  and sacred sentence  (But whom say ye that I  am? —Matt, xvi.  15)  into conformity  with  modern usage?  Of the examples  that  follow (more than one from contemporary writers held in high esteem), the earlier  show  easily  intelligible  whoms, because an active verb follows  that could be supposed by a very careless person to be governing it, but in the later ones a passive verb or something equivalent  puts  that  explanation out of  court:  The German  people,  whom Hitler had  determined  should  not survive defeat, did survive.  /  Lord  Montgomery liked  to  choose  his own  subordinates  and to  have around him only men  whom  he knew  respected  him.  /  Your  reviewer, whom /  suspect  does not like this book.  /  Banquo's  issue  whom  the witches predicted  would be king.  /  The  girl whom  you wish was a boy.

I. M. Stewart must now  be quite as well known as Michael Innes,  whom  he also is. After reading these we can perhaps conclude  that  the decisive influence is probably the vague impression before- hand  that  whom  is more  likely  to be right; but it need hardly be said  that slapdash  procedure of  that  kind de- serves  no mercy when it  fails.  That every  whom  in those quotations ought grammatically  to be  who  is beyond question, and to prove it is waste of  time since  the offenders themselves would admit the offence; they commit it because they prefer gambling on prob- abilities  to working out a certainty. As,  however, an unsound proof is worse than no proof at all, discrediting, when itself discredited, the  truth  that depends on it, one argument some- times brought against this use  of  whom should be abandoned. This is  that  the necessity  of the correct form  (whether who  or  whom)  is shown when it is realized  that  the words between  who(m) and  what  decides its case are parenthe- tic— Ferdinand  who (they  suppose)  is drown''d.  It is  true  that that  analysis  is much more often possible than im- possible;  it is even sometimes, though rarely,  probable. But it is often impos- sible,  as  in  :  Jones,  who I never thought was in the running, has won.  That  sen- tence is built up thus. Jones  has  won; I  never thought  that  Jones was in the running: Jones, I never thought (that) who was in the running, has won: Jones,  who I never thought was in the running, has won. No parenthesis there; nor, surely, in most examples where it is  logically  possible. A  single live  example  of the impossible paren- thesis is:  Cambridge's  Vice-Chancellor lumped  all  these  interesting  and  inspiring folk  together  as  'foreigners  and  others', whom he did not intend should  dese- crate  Cambridge by their  presence  on a Sunday. Whom  should be  who,  not on the parenthesis argument, since  'he did not  intend'  cannot be parenthetic, but because the object  of  did not intend is  the clause  'that  who should dese- crate'. The argument from parenthesis is  unsound, unless indeed its cham- pions are prepared to  support  it seriously  by the analogy of 'You are a beauty, I  don't  think', where the essen- tial main statement is playfully dressed up  as  a parenthesis. But it is as  true  that who  is the only right case in the quoted sentences as it would be if the paren- thesis argument were unassailable.",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

That consummation will not be brought about  just  yet;  but we  contribute  our little towards it every  time  we  write The  greatest  poet  that  ever  lived,  or  Tlie man  that  I  found  confronting  me,  instead of  using  who  and  whom.  Failing the use of  that  as the only defining relative, it is  particularly  important  to see  that who   defining  shall  not  have a comma before it, and  who  non-defining shall.  Readers of the  'Westminster', who  are also readers at the  great Bloomsbury  institution, will be able to  admire the new  decorations  for them- selves.  Those wrong commas (see WHICH  7) make the sentence imply  that all  readers  of  the  'Westminster'  fre- quent  the British Museum. For the omission  of the relative in defining clauses  see  THAT,  REL.  PRON. 4. 4.  And  or  but  who(m).  The use of these is naturally  attended  by the same dangers as  that  of  and which. These have been fully discussed under WHICH  WITH  AND OR BUT, and  nothing need  here be added beyond a few specimens containing  who(tn);  the letters appended refer to the table of faults given in  that  article:  Alfred Beasley  was examined as to a meeting at which Mrs. Pankhurst was  present  and a  note  of whose  speech  he had taken (A).  /  A letter speaks of the  sorrows  of children  which   their parents are powerless  to assuage,  and who have little experience of the joys of  childhood (B).  /  The working classes,  for long in enjoyment  of all the  blessings  of  '  Tariff Reform*,  and who are  therefore  fully competent  to appreciate their value, are moving  with  a  startling  rapidity towards  Socialism  (F). /  We should be glad  of  further  assistance  to pay the  cost of  putting up relatives of men  who  live in the  provinces,  and to  whom  we like to  extend invitations to come and stay near them for a few  days  at a time  (B). In this last, the antecedent of  who  is men,  but  that  of  whom  is  relatives. 5.  Person and  number  of  who{m). To me, who  has  also  a copy of it, it seems  a somewhat trivial  fragment.  Read have',  the relatives take the person of their  antecedents; the Lord's Prayer and the Collects,  with  which art, who shetoest,  and scores of  other  examples, are overwhelming evidence  that  who is  not a third-person word, but a word of  whichever person is appropriate. The relatives take also the  number of  their  antecedents—a  rule broken in  :  The death of Dr. Clifford  removes one  of the few  Free Churchmen whose work  had given  him  a national reputa- tion.  The antecedent of  whose  is not one,  but  Churchmen,  whereas the use of  him  instead of  them  shows  that  the writer  assigned  whose  to  one;  read either  removes  a  Churchman  whose  work had given him,  or  removes one of the few  Churchmen whose  work  has given them.  See  NUMBER  5. 6. Personification.  Who(m)  must  be ventured on in personifications only with  great caution. It  will  be  admitted that  in the following  who  is intolerable, and  which  the right word:  The joint operation  for  'pinching  out' the little  king- dom of Serbia,  who  had the audacity to play in the Balkan  Peninsula  a  part ana- logous  to that which  the  little  kingdom  of Piedmont  had played in the old  days  in Italy.  Yet, if we had had  little Serbia instead  of  the little kingdom of Serbia, who  might have passed. Again,  when we say  that  a ship has lost  her  rudder, we personify; yet, though  She had  lost her  rudder  is good English,  The ship, who  had lost her rudder  is not, nor even The Arethusa, who  etc.;  both  these can do  with  her,  but not  with  who; possibly  Arethusa, who  (and the naval writers  drop  the  the  with  ships' names) is  blameless; if so, it is because the name standing alone emphasizes per- sonification, which  must  not be  half- hearted or dubious if  who  is to follow.

"will,","vb.  1.  Forms. 2.  Will  and  shall. 3.  The 'presumptive'  and  the  'habitual' will. 1.  Forms. There is a verb  to will, conjugated  regularly  throughout— will, wiliest, wills, willed,  zoilledst, willing;  it means to intend so far as one has power  that  so-and-so shall come about, the so-and-so being ex- pressed  by a noun or a  r/zar-clause  or an  infinitive  with  to: You willed his death, that he  shoidd  die, to kill him. The much commoner auxiliary verb has  none of the above forms  except will,  and on the other hand has  wilt and  would  and  would(e)sf,  it has  also none of the above constructions, but is  followed by an infinitive  without  to  : He will die, Would it be  true? 2 .  Will  and  shall.  The meaning of this auxiliary  is curiously complicated by a partial exchange of functions  with shall,  the work  of  merely  giving future   and conditional forms  to other verbs being divided between cer- tain persons  of  shall  and certain persons of  will,  while the parts of each not so employed retain something  of  the senses  of ordering or  permitting (shall)  and  intending   (will)  that originally  belonged to the stems. These might be called respectively the 'plain'  and the 'coloured' functions of the auxiliary. Here the  English  of the  English differs  from the  English  of those who are  not  English.  The idiom of the former may be roughly summarized thus:  that  in  the  first person  shall  is the  'plain*  auxiliary and  will  the 'coloured', and  in  the second and third persons it is the other way about. 'I shall see him tomorrow' implies no more than  that that  event will occur; 'I will see him tomorrow' implies  that  I intend to do so. Con- versely  'You  (or they) will see him tomorrow' implies no more than  that that  event will occur; 'You (or they) shall  see him tomorrow'  implies promise or permission.  That  bare summary  gives  a very incomplete picture ; dividing lines are blurred and broached, as for instance by the em- phatic  shall  used in the first person ('You surely  won't  do  that';  'Indeed I shalV)  and the use of  will  in the second  and third persons in  giving formal orders ('You will proceed at full  speed to . .  .'  ; 'The company will attack at dawn'). But in its essentials it has long been regarded as the shibboleth of the Englishman's alloca- tion of duties to these auxiliaries, especially  the use of  shall  and  should as  the 'plain' ones in the first person. The increasing number of those who cannot 'frame to pronounce it right', reveals  the power wielded by Ameri- cans  and Scots and others who are not English.  That  power need not be grudged  them,  and it is perhaps presumption to take for granted  that shibboleth  is  better  than  sibboleth.  But",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

The idiom has been illustrated under SHALL;  a  small selection  is  here added of  various common wrong forms,  with references  to the  sections  of  shall: See  SHALL,  1 If  we add too  much  to  these  de- mands  we  mil  be in  grave danger  of getting nothing.  /  Read  shall  for  zvill.

working and stylish words.,"No one, unless he has happened  upon  this article at a very early stage of his acquaintance  with  this book, will sup- pose  that  the word  stylish  is meant to be laudatory. Nor is it; but neither is this selection of stylish words to be taken for a blacklist of out-and-out undesirables.  Many of  them  are stylish only  when they are used in certain senses,  being themselves in other senses working words; e.g.,  VIABLE  is a work- ing  word to apply to a newly formed organism,  though nothing if not stylish when used to indicate  that  a political programme is practicable ;  initiate  is a working word for formal admission to an  office or society though stylish as a mere synonym for  begin;  DEEM  is  a working word in the sense  in  which lawyers  use it, though stylish for think.  Others  again,  such as  bodeful and  dwell  and  perchance,  lose their unhappy stylish air when they are in surroundings of their own kind, where they are not conspicuous like an escaped  canary among the sparrows. What  is to be deprecated is the notion that  one can improve one's style by using  stylish words, or  that  important",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf

worn-out humour,"stated  a  fact  that  was disconcerting  to someone. Yet the  thing  was very likely amusing  in its nature  ;  it  did not amuse the person whose amusement mattered, that  was all. The writer's Queen Vic- toria  is his  public,  and he  would  do well  to  keep  a  bust  of the old  Queen on  his  desk  with  the  legend  'We are not amused' hanging from  it. His public will  not be  amused  if  he serves it  up the  small facetiae  that  it  remem- bers long ago  to  have taken delight  in. We recognize this about anecdotes, avoid  putting  on our  friends  the de- pressing  duty  of  simulating surprise, and sort  our  stock into chestnuts and still  possibles. Anecdotes  are our pounds, and we take care of  them;  but of  the  phrases  that  are our  pence  we are more neglectful. Of the specimens of  worn-out  humour exhibited below nearly  all have had  point  and liveliness in their  time;  but  with  every year  that they remain current  the  proportion of readers who are  'not  amused'  to  those who find  them  fresh  and new  inex- orably  rises.

Changes  in the meaning  of  words,  and  still more  in their emotional content, often reflect changes  of  opinion about  the  value of what  they stand  for.  Occasionally  a pejorative word becomes commenda- tory—BAROQUE  and  prestige  for in- stance—but  much more often  it  is  the other way about.  Imperialism  was de- fined at  the end  of  the  19th  c. as 'a greater pride in empire, a larger  patriot- ism'  ;  in the  middle  of  the 20th  it  was described  as 'a  word  so  charged  with hostile meaning  as to be  almost use- less.'  Colonialism  has  a  different  signi- ficance today from  what  it  had when we prided ourselves  on  carrying  the white  man's burden. The degradation of  BOURGEOIS  and  capitalist  is  notorious, and  class,  as  a  social  term,  has become unmentionable (see  GROUP).  Appease- ment  has  suffered  a  similar change: there  is no  hint  in the OED definitions of  anything discreditable  or  humiliat- ing  about  that  word.  No  one thought any  the  worse  of  Aeneas  for  letting Cerberus have  his  usual sop. Under the influence of  EUPHEMISM  the  blame- less  word  EPITHET  is  becoming  ob- jurgatory,  and the  second world  war has  taken the virtue out of  collaborator.

worth,"time  unless  it is a  means  of  material advancement.  Hypothesis  seems  to be going  the  same  way.  'Today',  says Medawar,  'the  pejorative use  of  hypo- thesis  {Evolution  is only an  h.;  It's only an h. that smoking causes lung  cancer)  is a sign  of  semi-literacy.'  Some old people may regret  that  a  pop singer  no  longer means  quite  what  it did in the  days when  Santley and Sims Reeves sang  in St. James's Hall,  and  that  a pop concert  is  no longer likely  to  consist of 'a  series  of  masses  and fugues and ""ops"" by Bach interwoven  with  Spohr  and Beethoven'. Possibly the waning of our conviction  that  all  progress  must  be beneficial will bring  a  converse  ex- perience  to  that  now highly pejorative word  REACTIONARY.  It  must  also  be some change  in  our  national character —perhaps  our  greater reserve  and selfconsciousness—that  explains  why many words, once reputable, are now seldom used  by  educated  people except  on a  note  of  parody: such are  buxom,  gallant,  genteel,  intrepid, sinful, virtuous, winsome. This article  is  concerned only  with a  few  modern  examples  of a process  that  goes  on  ceaselessly, imperceptibly,  and  uncontrollably. Looking  farther back,  we  should find many more words  that  have had simi- lar  experiences.  A  small sample  is: CANDID,  COMMONPLACE,  crafty,  GARBLE, EGREGIOUS,  idiot,  INDIFFERENT,  knave, leer,  lewd,  -MONGER  compounds, OF- FICIOUS, PLAUSIBLE,  prevent, purlieu, respectable,   rhetoric,   SENSUAL,   silly, SPECIOUS,  WORTHY,  villain. worser.  Of  this double comparative the OED  says:  'Common  in  the  16th and  17th  ce.  as  a  variant  of  worse  in  all its senses.  In  modern use  it is  partly a   literary  survival, especially  in phrases like  the  worser  part,  sort,  half, and partly dialect  and  vulgar,' illus- trating  the  last from Dickens:  Your poor  dear wife as you uses  worser  nor  a dog.  For  the  analogous  lesser  see  LESS. worth,  worth  while.  1.  In certain uses great  confusion  prevails, which can  be cleared  up  with  the aid of  grammar. The  important  fact is  that  the adjective worth  requires  what  is  most easily  de- scribed as an object.  It  is meaningless to say  This  is  worth,  but  sense  to  say This  is  worth sixpence,  or  This  is  worth saying  (i.e.  the  necessary  expenditure of  words),  or  This  is  worth  while  (i.e. the necessary  expenditure  of  time). But one such object satisfies its require- ments, so  that  This  is  worth while say- ing,  with  the separate objects  while  and saying,  is  ungrammatical. 2.  Worth  with  two  objects.  There  is no need  to  give more  than  two examples  of  this mistake;  all  that  is necessary  to  set  them  right  is to  omit while,  leaving  worth  with  one  object only— turning  in  the  first and  pursuing in  the  second.  A  spare  captain,  to  take charge  of  any  prize  that might be worth while turning into  a  raider.  /  Was  not that  a  line worth while pursuing? 3.  Worth  with  no  object.  The commonest cause of this mistake is  the anticipatory  it;  see  IT  I  and 2.  As is there  explained,  the  function  of the anticipatory  it  is to  herald  a  deferred subject.  It  follows  that  such  a  sentence as  It is  worth saying this  is  equivalent to  'It,  namely saying this,  is  worth'; worth  is  left  without  an  object,  and nonsense results. Such sentences,  if they  are  short  and  simple,  can be corrected  in  one  of  two  ways : either by  getting  rid of  the  it  or  by  inserting while.  It is  worth quoting  the  'Echo  de Paris'  can be  rewritten  either  The 'Echo  de Paris'  is  worth quoting  or  It  is worth  while  to  quote  etc.  It is  worth dwelling  011  this method  of  approach  can be  rewritten  either  This  method  of approach  is  worth dwelling  on  or  It is worth  while  to  dwell on etc.  For longer and more complex sentences  the insertion  of  while  may be the  only remedy, as  in  It  is  worth  recalling  Lord Salisbury's  declaration  in  188$  that, if  she  yielded  to  pressure,  we  would consider  ourselves  released  from  our obligations. 3.  If  an  initial  it  is not  anticipatory but  an  ordinary  pronoun  the  case  is of course  quite  different.  In /  have said this because  it is  zvorth saying  'it' is a pronoun whose antecedent  is  'this'",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
worth,"720 and  worth  is rightly given only one object— saying',  to  write  it is worth while  saying  would give it two. The following quotation shows the risk of confusion  :  In your excellent account of the late  Miss   there  is  one  omission,  and it is worth filling it up.  Here the first  it is  anticipatory, meaning 'filling it up' and the second is the ordinary pro- noun, meaning  'the  omission'. If the second is left out the first takes over its job; the sentence becomes  It (i.e. the  omission)  is worth filling up,  and all is  well. 4.  It is  true  that  in some sentences in which an anticipatory  it  is used there  are two possible views of  what It  stands for.  It is worth while re- marking  that the Greek National Anthem is really a very interesting and harmonious  air. j It is worth while pointing  out that out of an  electorate  of nearly  fourteen and a half millions no fewer  than four and a quarter million votes  were  recorded  in  1912  for the Socialist  candidates.  Does the first quotation mean  that  'it' (i.e. remarking this fact  about  the anthem) is  worth while, or  that  'it' (i.e. this fact  about the anthem) is  worth  while remark- ing?  Does the second mean  that  'it' (i.e. pointing out this fact  about  the election) is  worth  while or  that  'it' (i.e. this fact  about  the election) is worth  while pointing out?  If the former,  the  sentences are gram- matically  correct, if the latter  they  are not. But the meaning is substantially the same in either case, and we may be  content  to give the  writer  the benefit of the  doubt. 5.  A complication is sometimes intro- duced by a relative clause.  The  Chinese Labour  Corps and its organization was one  of the side  issues  of the war  zohich  is well  worth while to hear about.  The skeleton of this, before subordination by the relative, is :  The Corps was a side issue;  to hear about this  (issue)  is worth while,  or  it is worth while to hear about this.  Subordination by the relative should give accordingly either  to hear about  which is worth while,  or  which it is worth while to hear about.  But the writer  has taken  that  anticipatory  it,",Dictionary-3-FMEU.pdf
worthy,"(= to hear  about  which) for the ordi- nary  pronoun  it (—  this  issue),  and has  therefore left it out because he sup- poses it to mean only the same thing as the  which  that  is to connect the clause; the result is  that  his  which  is  both  sub- ject to  is  (which he has deprived of its it)  and object to  about.  Correct gram- mar would be either  which is well worth  hearing about,  or  which it is well  worth while to hear about,  or  which it is well worth while hearing about. 6.

It is  still  usual, in varying degrees, to  write  -x instead of  the English -s in the plurals of words in -eau and -eu borrowed from French, the pronunciation being -z, as in Eng- lish  plurals. It is to be hoped  that some day all of these  that  are in familiar English  use will be anglicized  with  -s; but a list of the chief words, here given with  an English plural in order  that the reader may judge of their looks, is admittedly forbidding: adieus; beaus; châteaus;  flambeaus;  plateaus;  port- manteaus; rouleaus; tableaus; trous- seaus.  The fact, however,  that  purlieu, which has all the air of a French word without  being one, looks right  with the plural -s  (purlieus)  because we are used to it suggests  that  courage  with the others might soon be rewarded. For  all of  them  except  beau, chateau, and  tableau  the COD admits a plural in -s. as an alternative.

In  tyler  and  tyre  differentiation  may have  been  at  work,  but  without  need; and  on  tyre  it  may  be  added  that,  in some  people's opinion,  to  say  that  tire is  the  American spelling  is a  sufficient reason  for our  using  tyre.  On the  con- trary, agreement between  English  and American spelling  is  much  to be de- sired  wherever  it is  practicable.  In gipsy  and  pigmy,  we  have dissimi- lation,  again  without  need;  for if invisibility  can  carry five  is,  these  can surely  do  with  two  .vs.  But the  fact that  stymie  has  prevailed over  both stimy  and  stymy  illustrates  the  power of  dissimilation;  and  it  may  be  guessed that  the y  starts  in the  oftener used stymied,  in  which  the  necessary  i  of  the second  syllable tends  to  produce  y in the first;  with  this compare  the  greater frequency  of the  correct  y in  gypsies and  pygmies  than  in  gypsy  and  pygmy.

zinc,"tion  between  the fact it introduces and that  which has gone before should be direct and clear. Examples of failure in this respect  must  necessarily be of some  length;  some simpler specimens of  a rather similar kind will be found under  BUT  3. In each of those  that follow it will be noticed  that  the particular fact  with  which the  Yet  sen- tence is in contrast is by no means the essential contents of the previous sentence, but has to be got out of it at the cost of some thought.  We  confess to  being  surprised  at the line taken by the  railwaymen  at Crewe with  reference to  Colonel  Yorkers  conclusion  that the Shrewsbury  disaster  occurred  through the  engine-driver having momentarily fallen  asleep.  Yet at a  meeting  the Crewe railwaymen are very indignant at the suggestion,  and  denounce  Colonel Yorke as an Army  officer  who does not under- stand  the real working of  railways.  Here the  Yet  fact is  that  the men are indig- nant.  What  is  that  in contrast with? Apparently  with  the correctness of Colonel Yorke's conclusion;  but, though many  other  things not in con- trast  with  their indignation can be got out of the sentence, the correctness of the conclusion is inferable only from the newspaper's surprise at the men's indignation at the conclusion. If  yet were  omitted,  the second sentence would come in  logically  enough  as  an explanation of  what  the men's  'line* referred  to had actually been. Sir,  I doubt if sufficient attention has been  drawn to the injustice of throwing on  the landlord in  whose  house  they hap- pen  to be resident the  cost  of a  large additional insurance benefit for  those who  are sick. Yet, under Clause  $1,  a sick  tenant would be able to live rent free  for  a  year at the  expense  of  his  or her landlord.  This is a  less  glaring  case. The essence of the  Yet  sentence is  that a  tenant  has power to injure a land- lord.  What  is  that  in contrast with? With  the  fact  that  justice should  protect landlords;  that  is, not  with  the main sentencepreceding,whichisa  statement of  why the writer is writing, but  with a  mere inference from a noun  that occurs in it, viz.  'injustice'.  As in the first example, the logical work of the second sentence is to explain the nature of  a noun contained in the first, but an  explanation is presented in the guise  of contrast; the sentence would do its work properly  if  yet  were  omit- ted. No  doubt  the contrast  that  was at the back of the writer's mind, but did not come to the front of it, was  between the greatness of the injustice and the lack  of public interest in it. 2.  Yet  in its temporal sense may be ambiguous: its old sense of  'now  as before', 'still' has lasted longer in Scotland  and Ireland than in England.
