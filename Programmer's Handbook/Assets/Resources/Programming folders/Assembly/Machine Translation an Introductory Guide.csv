Preface,"Automatic translation between human languages (‘Machine Translation’) is a Science 
 Fic-tion staple, and a long-term scientific dream of enormous social, political, and 
 scientific importance. It was one of the earliest applications suggested for digital 
 computers, but turning this dream into reality has turned out to be a much harder, and in 
 many ways a much more interesting task than at first appeared. Nevertheless, though 
 there remain many outstanding problems, some degree of automatic translation is now a 
 daily reality, and it is likely that during the next decade the bulk of routine technical and 
 business translation will be done with some kind of automatic translation tool, from 
 humble databases containing canned translations of technical terms to genuine Machine 
 Translation Systems that can produce reasonable draft translations (provided the input 
 observes certain restrictions on subject matter, style, and vocabulary).
  
 Unfortunately, how this is possible or what it really means is hard to appreciate for those 
 without the time, patience, or training to read the relevant academic research papers, 
 which in any case do not give a very good picture of what is involved in practice. It was 
 for this reason that we decided to try to write a book which would be genuinely 
 introductory (in the sense of not presupposing a background in any relevant discipline), 
 but which would look at all aspects of Machine Translation: covering questions of what it 
 is like to use a modern Machine Translation system, through questions about how it is 
 done, to questions of evaluating systems, and what developments can be foreseen in the 
 near to medium future.
  
 We would like to express our thanks to various people. First, we would like to thank each 
 other. The process of writing this book has been slower than we originally hoped (five 
 authors is five pairs of hands, but also five sets of opinions). However, we think that our 
 extensive discussions and revisions have in the end produced a better book in terms of 
 content, style, presentation, and so on. We think we deserve no little credit for 
 maintaining a pleasant working atmosphere while expending this level of effort and 
 commitment while under pressure caused by other academic responsibilities.
  
 We would also like to thank our colleagues at the Computational Linguistics and Ma-
 chine Translation (CL/MT) group at the University of Essex for suggestions and practical 
 support, especially Lisa Hamilton, Kerry Maxwell, Dave Moffat, Tim Nicholas, Melissa 
 Parker, Martin Rondell and Andy Way.

Introduction and Overview,NA,NA
1.1 ,NA,NA
Introduction,"The topic of the book is the art or science of
  Automatic Translation
 , or
  Machine 
 Trans-lation
  (MT) as it is generally known — the attempt to automate all, or part of the 
 process of translating from one human language to another. The aim of the book is to 
 introduce this topic to the general reader — anyone interested in human language, 
 translation, or computers. The idea is to give the reader a clear basic understanding of the 
 state of the art, both in terms of
  what
  is currently possible, and
  how
  it is achieved, and of 
 what develop-ments are on the horizon. This should be especially interesting to anyone 
 who is associated with what are sometimes called “the language industries”; particularly 
 translators, those training to be translators, and those who commission or use translations 
 extensively. But the topics the book deals with are of general and lasting interest, as we 
 hope the book will demonstrate, and no specialist knowledge is presupposed — no 
 background in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Linguistics, or Translation 
 Studies.
  
 Though the purpose of this book is introductory, it is not
  just
  introductory. For one thing, 
 we will, in Chapter 10, bring the reader up to date with the most recent developments. 
 For another, as well as giving an accurate picture of the state of the art, both practically 
 and theoretically, we have taken a position on some of what seem to us to be the key 
 issues in MT today — the fact is that we have some axes to grind.
  
 From the earliest days, MT has been bedevilled by grandiose claims and exaggerated ex-
 pectations. MT researchers and developers should stop over-selling. The general public 
 should stop over-expecting. One of the main aims of this book is that the reader comes to 
 appreciate where we are today in terms of actual achievement, reasonable expectation, 
 and unreasonable hype. This is not the kind of thing that one can sum up in a catchy 
 headline (“No Prospect for MT” or “MT Removes the Language Barrier”), but it is 
 something one can absorb, and which one can thereafter use to distill the essence of truth 
 that will lie behind reports of products and research.

1.2 Why MT Matters,"The topic of MT is one that we have found sufficiently interesting to spend most of our 
 professional lives investigating, and we hope the reader will come to share, or at least 
 understand, this interest. But whatever one may think about its intrinsic interest, it is 
 undoubtedly an important topic — socially, politically, commercially, scientifically, and 
 intellectually or philosophically — and one whose importance is likely to increase as the 
 20th Century ends, and the 21st begins.
  
 The
  social
  or
  political
  importance of MT arises from the socio-political importance of 
 translation in communities where more than one language is generally spoken. Here the 
 only viable alternative to rather widespread use of translation is the adoption of a single 
 common ‘lingua franca’, which (despite what one might first think) is not a particularly 
 attractive alternative, because it involves the dominance of the chosen language, to the 
 disadvantage of speakers of the other languages, and raises the prospect of the other lan-
 guages becoming second-class, and ultimately disappearing. Since the loss of a language 
 often involves the disappearance of a distinctive culture, and a way of thinking, this is a 
 loss that should matter to everyone. So translation is necessary for communication — for 
 ordinary human interaction, and for gathering the information one needs to play a full 
 part in society. Being allowed to express yourself in your own language, and to receive 
 infor-mation that directly affects you in the same medium, seems to be an important, if 
 often violated, right. And it is one that depends on the availability of translation. The 
 problem is that the demand for translation in the modern world far outstrips any possible 
 supply. Part of the problem is that there are too few human translators, and that there is a 
 limit on how far their productivity can be increased without automation. In short, it 
 seems as though automation of translation is a social and political necessity for modern 
 societies which do not wish to impose a common language on their members.
  
 This is a point that is often missed by people who live in communities where one lan-
 guage is dominant, and who speak the dominant language. Speakers of English in places 
 like Britain, and the Northern USA are examples. However, even they rapidly come to 
 appreciate it when they visit an area where English is not dominant (for example, Welsh 
 speaking areas of Britain, parts of the USA where the majority language is Spanish, not 
 to mention most other countries in the world). For countries like Canada and 
 Switzerland, and organizations like the European Community and the UN, for whom 
 multilingualism is both a basic principle and a fact of every day life, the point is obvious.
  
 The
  commercial
  importance of MT is a result of related factors. First, translation itself is 
 commercially important: faced with a choice between a product with an instruction 
 manual in English, and one whose manual is written in Japanese, most English speakers 
 will buy the former — and in the case of a repair manual for a piece of manufacturing 
 machinery or the manual for a safety critical system, this is not just a matter of taste. Sec-
 ondly, translation is expensive. Translation is a highly skilled job, requiring much more 
 than mere knowledge of a number of languages, and in some countries at least, 
 translators’salaries are comparable to other highly trained professionals. Moreover, 
 delays in transla-tion are costly. Estimates vary, but producing high quality translations 
 of difficult material,

1.3 Popular Conceptions and Misconceptions,"Some popular misconceptions about MT are listed on page 7. We will discuss them in 
 turn.
  
  “MT is a waste of time because you will never make a machine that can translate Shake-
 speare”.
  
 The criticism that MT systems cannot, and will never, produce translations of great liter-
 ature of any great merit is probably correct, but quite beside the point. It certainly does 
 not show that MT is impossible. First, translating literature requires special literary 
 skill— it is not the kind of thing that the average professional translator normally 
 attempts. So accepting the criticism does not show that automatic translation of non-
 literary texts is impossible. Second, literary translation is a small proportion of the 
 translation that has to be done, so accepting the criticism does not mean that MT is 
 useless. Finally, one may wonder who would ever
  want
  to translate Shakespeare by 
 machine — it is a job that hu-man translators find challenging and rewarding, and it is 
 not a job that MT systems have been designed for. The criticism that MT systems cannot 
 translate Shakespeare is a bit like criticism of industrial robots for not being able to dance 
 Swan Lake.
  
  “There was/is an MT system which translated
  The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak 
 into the Russian equivalent of
  The vodka is good, but the steak is lousy
 , and
  hydraulic 
 ram 
 into the French equivalent of
  water goat
 . MT is useless.”
  
 The ‘spirit is willing’ story is amusing, and it really is a pity that it is not true. However, 
 like most MT ‘howlers’ it is a fabrication. In fact, for the most part, they were in 
 circulation long before any MT system could have produced them (variants of the ‘spirit 
 is willing’example can be found in the American press as early as 1956, but sadly, there 
 does not seem to have been an MT system in America which could translate from 
 English into Russian until much more recently — for sound strategic reasons, work in the 
 USA had concentrated on the translation of Russian into English, not the other way 
 round). Of course, there are real MT howlers. Two of the nicest are the translation of 
 French
  avocat 
 (‘advocate’, ‘lawyer’ or ‘barrister’) as
  avocado
 , and the translation of
  Les 
 soldats sont dans le caf´e
  as
  The soldiers are in the coffee
 . However, they are not as easy 
 to find as the reader might think, and they certainly do not show that MT is useless.
  
  “Generally, the quality of translation you can get from an MT system is very low. This 
 makes them useless in practice.”
  
 6",NA
1.4 A Bit of History,"There is some dispute about who first had the idea of translating automatically between 
 human languages, but the actual development of MT can be traced to conversations and 
 correspondence between Andrew D. Booth, a British crystallographer, and Warren 
 Weaver of the Rockefeller Foundation in 1947, and more specifically to a memorandum 
 written by Weaver in 1949 to the Rockerfeller Foundation which included the following 
 two sen-tences.
  
 “I have a text in front of me which is written in Russian but I am going to 
 pretend that it is really written in English and that it has been coded in some 
 strange symbols. All I need to do is strip off the code in order to retrieve the 
 information contained in the text.”
  
 The analogy of translation and decoding may strike the sophisticated reader as simplistic 
 (however complicated coding gets it is still basically a one-for-one substitution process 
 where there is only one right answer — translation is a far more complex and subtle 
 business), and later in the memorandum Weaver proposed some other more sophisticated

Summary,"This chapter has given an outline of the rest of the book, and given a potted history of 
 MT. It has also tried to lay a few ghosts, in the form of misconceptions which haunt the 
 enterprise. Above all we hope to convince the reader that MT is possible and potentially 
 useful, despite current limitations.
  
 15",NA
1.6 Further Reading,"A broad, practically oriented view of the field of current MT by a variety of authors can 
 be found in Newton (1992a). Generally speaking, the best source of material that takes an 
 MT user’s viewpoint is the series of books titled
  Translating and the Computer
 , with 
 various editors and publishers, including Lawson (1982a), Snell (1979), Snell (1982), 
 Lawson (1982b), Picken (1985), Picken (1986), Picken (1987), Picken (1988), Mayorcas 
 (1990), Picken (1990), and Mayorcas (Forthcoming). These are the published 
 proceedings of the annual Conference on Translating and the Computer, sponsored by 
 Aslib (The Association for Information Management), and the Institute for Translation 
 and Interpreting.
  
 By far the best technical introduction to MT is Hutchins and Somers (1992). This would 
 be appropriate for readers who want to know more technical and scientific details about 
 MT, and we will often refer to it in later chapters. This book contains useful discussions of 
 some of the main MT systems, but for descriptions of these systems by their actual 
 designers the reader should look at Slocum (1988), and King (1987). Slocum’s 
 introduction to the for-mer, Slocum (1986), is particularly recommended as an overview 
 of the key issues in MT. These books all contain detailed descriptions of the research of 
 the TAUM group which de-veloped 
  
  
 the 
 METEO system referred to in section 1.3. The METEO system is discussed further in 
 Chapter 8.
  
 A short assessment of the current state of MT in terms of availability and use of systems 
 in Europe, North America, and Japan and East Asia can be found in Pugh (1992). An up-
 to-date picture of the state of MT as regards both commercial and scientific points of 
 view is provided every two years by the
  Machine Translation Summits
 . A report of one 
 of these can be found in Nagao (1989). There is a description of the successful use of MT 
 in a corporate setting in Newton (1992b).
  
 On the history of MT (which we have outlined here, but which will not be discussed 
 again), the most comprehensive discussion can be found in Hutchins (1986), though there 
 are also useful discussions in Warwick (1987), and Buchmann (1987). Nagao (1986) also 
 provides a useful insight into the history of MT, together with a general introduction to 
 MT. The ALPAC report is Pierce and Carroll (1966). The work of Wilks’ that is referred 
 to in section 1.4 is Wilks (1973).
  
 For general descriptions and discussion of the activity of translation (both human and 
 machine) Picken (1989) is a useful and up-to-date source. This contains references to (for 
 example) works on translation theory, and gives a great deal of practical information of 
 value to translators (such as lists national translators’ and interpreters’ organizations, and 
 bibliographies of translations).
  
 For up-to-date information about the state of MT, there is the newsletter of the 
 International Association for Machine Translation
  MT News International
 . See the list of 
 addresses on page 207.",NA

New Directions in MT,NA,NA
10.1 ,NA,NA
Introduction,"In the previous chapters, we have tried to give an idea of what is currently possible in 
 MT. In this chapter, we look to the future. Our aim is to give a flavour of current research 
 in MT, indicating what issues are receiving attention and what techniques are thought to 
 be promising.
  
 Of course, not all the ideas that are currently important are really
  new
  ones. A great deal 
 of current research is directed at how familiar techniques can be improved — for 
 example, how standard ‘Linguistic Knowledge’approaches can be improved by using 
 better linguis-tic analyses (analyses based on better linguistic theories, or a better 
 understanding of ex-isting theories), and developing or adapting more efficient 
 processing methods, and better tools for use in constructing and modifying systems. 
 Likewise, an important feature of current research involves work on sublanguage MT (cf. 
 Chapter 8), but though the design of tools to aid sublanguage analysis is an increasingly 
 important area, it is hardly a new development. Other currently important work is 
 concerned with
  integration
 , which can re-late either to the integration of MT with other 
 Natural Language Processing technologies, or to the (non-trivial) problems of integration 
 of MT into general document processing technology that arise as one tries to make a 
 practically and commercially usable system out of a research prototype MT system. A 
 particularly important example of the former is research on ‘speech-to-speech’ MT 
 systems — that is, systems that can take spoken input, and produce spoken output (e.g. 
 for more or less simultaneous interpreting of telephone conversations). Such work is 
 clearly important, and often throws up interesting differences of emphasis (for example, 
 in speech-to-speech work, there is an emphasis on speed, and on dealing with sentence 
 fragments, since one would like to be able to translate each ut-terance as it is spoken, 
 without waiting for the end. This gives importance to ‘bottom up’methods of analysis, 
 and severe restrictions on the input in terms of text-type, etc). How-ever, there is an 
 obvious sense in which such work it is ‘more of the same’ — it involves improving one 
 aspect of an existing idea, rather than presenting a genuinely new direction,
  
 173",NA
10.2 Rule-Based MT,"10.2.1 Flexible or Multi-level MT
  
 Most transfer or interlingual rule-based systems are based on the idea that success in 
 prac-tical MT involves defining a level of representations for texts which is abstract 
 enough to make translation itself straightforward, but which is at the same time 
 superficial enough to permit sentences in the various source and target languages to be 
 successfully mapped",NA
10.3 Resources for MT,"As researchers begin to consider the implications of developing their systems beyond the 
 level of proof-of-concept research prototypes with very restricted coverage, considerable 
 attention is being paid to the role that existing bilingual and monolingual corpus and 
 lexical resources can play. A corpus is essentially a large collection of texts, but for our 
 purposes we are interested only in such texts stored on computers in a standard format 
 (e.g. extended ASCII). Such texts may often contain standard markup (e.g. in SGML) 
 and for most practical purposes one needs a set of corpus access tools for retrieving data 
 at will.
  
 Various research centres throughout the world have been developing monolingual corpus 
 resources for many years, and there has been a growing awareness throughout the 
 eighties of their importance to linguistic and lexicographic work. A number of sites hold 
 substan-tial corpus resources (several millions of words), an example being the Unit for 
 Computer Research on the English Language at the University of Lancaster which 
 currently holds in excess of 5 million words of corpus material, of which 4M words have 
 been tagged with part-of-speech information. Such collections are a rich repository of 
 information about actual language usage. Efforts are underway at different centres to 
 (automatically or semi-",NA
10.4 Empirical Approaches to MT,"Given the questions that have been raised about the feasibility of ‘rule-based’ 
 approaches, the increasing availability of large amounts of machine readable textual 
 material has been seen by a number of research groups as opening possibilities for rather 
 different MT archi-tectures — in particular, so called ‘empirical’ architectures which 
 apply relatively ‘low-level’ statistical or pattern matching techniques either directly to 
 texts, or to texts that have been subject to only rather superficial analysis. The reasoning 
 behind the term empirical is that in such approaches, whatever linguistic knowledge the 
 system uses is derived em-
  
 2
 This may use the measure of Mutual Information, taking into account (roughly) the amount of mutual context 
 elements share",NA
10.5 Summary,"We have tried in this chapter to give a brief overview of some of the issues and 
 techniques which are being actively researched today in MT. Of course, there is not 
 enough room in one chapter to do justice to the field, and we have of necessity omitted 
 much work that is of interest. In particular, we have restricted our discussion to MT itself 
 and have said nothing at all about recent work in the development of translators aids, 
 multilingual authoring packages and terminological systems of various sorts. Nonetheless 
 we have identified three important trends in current research in MT. The first is the 
 exploitation of current techniques from computational linguistics to permit a 
 multidimensional view of the translational relation between two texts. The second in the 
 increasing orientation of the research community towards the use of existing resources of 
 various sorts, either to extract useful information or directly as components in systems. 
 The third, related, trend is towards statistical or empirical models of translation. Though 
 we have dwelt in some detail in this short survey on ‘pure’ statistical and simple pattern 
 matching methods, in fact much recent work advocates a mixture of techniques, for 
 example with statistical methods supplementing rule-based methods in various ways.",NA
10.6 Further Reading,"Our discussion of flexible translation between Swedish and Norwegian is based on un-
 published work by Dyvik (1992). The standard references on sign-based approaches to 
 linguistic representation are Pollard and Sag (1987, 1993). The view of constraint based 
 translation that we describe is loosely modelled on that used in ‘Shake and Bake’ White-
 lock (1992); Beaven (1992). See Kaplan et al. (1989), Sadler (1991) and Sadler (1993) 
 for a slightly different approach. General discussion of how multi-dimensional represen-
 tations can be used in MT can be found in Sadler and Arnold (1993).
  
 On knowledge-based MT see Goodman and Nirenburg (1991), and the special issue of the 
 journal
  Machine Translation
 , Goodman (1989).
  
 On the processing of corpora, and their use in linguistics generally, see Garside et al. 
 (1987), and Aijmer and Altenberg (1991).
  
 The idea of example-based MT was first discussed in a paper by Nagao Nagao (1984). For 
 a review of more recent work along these lines, see Somers (1992).
  
 The pure statistical approach to MT is based on the work of a team at IBM, see for 
 example Brown et al. (1990). As regards aligned, bilingual corpora, the most common 
 form of alignment takes the sentence to be the organizing unit for chunking, see Brown et 
 al. (1991) and Gale and Church (1991b) for relevant discussion. On automatic extraction

Introduction,"At the time of writing, the use of MT — or indeed, any sort of computerised tool for 
 translation support — is completely unknown to the vast majority of individuals and or-
 ganizations in the world, even those involved in the so called ‘language industries’, like 
 translators, terminologists, technical writers, etc.
  
 Given this, one of the first things a reader is likely to want to know about MT is what it 
 might be like to work with an MT system and how it fits in with the day-to-day business 
 of translation. The purpose of the present chapter is to provide just such information — a 
 view of MT at the user level, and from the outside. In later chapters we shall in effect lift 
 off the covers of an MT system and take a look at what goes on inside. For the moment, 
 however, the central components of an MT system are treated as a black box.
  
 We introduce the business of MT in terms of a scenario describing the usage of MT in-
 side a fairly large multinational corporation. The scenario is not based exactly on any one 
 existing corporation. Our description is somewhat idealised in that we assume methods 
 of working which are only just starting to come into use. However, there is nothing idly 
 futuristic in our description: it is based on a consensus view of commercial MT experts 
 and envisages tools which we know to be either already available or in an advanced state 
 of development in Europe or elsewhere. The commercialisation of MT is not awaiting 
 a‘miracle breakthrough’ in the science of MT; it is not necessary, nor do we expect it to 
 occur. What will happen over the next ten years are progressive improvements in func-
 tionality and performance which, taken in conjunction with the continuously falling costs 
 of basic computing power, will ensure that MT becomes more and more cost effective. In 
 short, we have no doubt that in general outline, if not in every detail, we are sketching the 
 professional life of the machine translator in the 90s, and of most translators in the early 
 part of the next century.
  
 17",NA
2.2 The Scenario,"Let us suppose that you are a native English speaker engaged as a professional German-
 English translator in the Language Centre for a multinational manufacturing company. 
 One of the products this company supplies is computer products. In this organization the 
 Language Centre is principally responsible for the translation of documents created 
 within the company into a variety of European and Oriental languages. The Language 
 Centre is also charged with exercising control over the content and presentation of 
 company docu-mentation in general. To this end, it attempts to specify standards for the 
 final appearance of documents in distributed form, including style, terminology, and 
 content in general. The overall policy is enshrined in the form of a corporate
  Document 
 Design and Content Guide
  which the Centre periodically updates and revises.
  
 The material for which MT is to be used consists of technical documentation such as 
 User and Repair manuals for software and hardware products manufactured or sourced 
 by the company. Some classes of highly routine internal business correspondence are 
 also sub-mitted for MT. Legal and marketing material, and much external business 
 correspondence, is normally translated by hand, although some translators in the 
 organization prefer to use MT here as well.
  
 All material for translation is available in electronic form on a computer network which 
 supports the company’s documentation system. Although most documents will be printed 
 out at some point as standard paper User Manuals and so forth, the system also supports 
 the preparation of multi-media hypertext documents. These are documents which exist 
 primarily in electronic form with a sophisticated cross-reference system; they contain 
 both text and pictures (and perhaps speech and other sounds). These documents are 
 usually distributed to their final users as CD-ROMs, although they can be distributed in 
 other electronic forms, including electronic mail. Printed versions of these documents 
 can also be made.
  
 Everyone in the language department has a workstation — an individual computer. These 
 are linked together by the network. The documentation system which runs on this 
 network allows users to create and modify documents by typing in text; in other words, it 
 provides very sophisticated word processing facilities. It also provides sophisticated 
 means for storing and retrieving electronic documents, and for passing them around the 
 network inside the company or via external networks to external organizations. As is 
 usual with current computer systems, everything is done with the help of a friendly 
 interface based on windows, icons and menus, selections being made with a mouse.
  
 The MT system which you use is called ETRANS and forms part of the overall 
 documen-tation system. (ETRANS is just a name we have invented for a prototypical 
 MT system.) Parts of an electronic document on the system can be sent to the MT system 
 in the same way that they can be sent to a printer or to another device or facility on the

 person using it, behaves as if it is his or her own personal MT system.

Document Preparation: Authoring and Pre-Editing,"The corporate language policy as described in the scenario tries to ensure that text which 
 is submitted to an MT system is written in a way which helps to achieve the best possible 
 raw MT output. A human translator will often be able to turn a badly written text into a 
 well written translation; an MT system certainly will not. Bad input means bad output. 
 Exactly what constitutes

2.4 The Translation Process,"In the scenario we sketched above, the source text or some selected portion thereof was 
 passed to the translation system which then produced raw translated output without any 
 further human intervention. In fact, this is merely one of many ways the translation step 
 can proceed.
  
 2.4.1 Dictionary-Based Translation Support Tools
  
 One point to bear in mind is that translation support can be given without actually 
 provid-ing full automatic translation. All MT systems are linked to electronic dictionaries 
 which, for the present discussion, we can regard as sophisticated variants of their paper 
 cousins. Such electronic dictionaries can be of immense help even if they are supplied or 
 used without automatic translation of text. Here is one possible scenario:
  
 You are translating a text by hand. Using a mouse or the keyboard, 
 you click on a word in the source text and a list of its possible 
 translations is shown on screen. You click on the possible translation 
 which seems most appropriate in the context and it is inserted directly 
 into the target language text. Since you usually do this before you 
 start typing in the translation of the sentence which contains the 
 unknown work, the",NA

Document Revision,"The main factor which decides the amount of post-editing that needs to be done on a 
 translation produced by machine is of course the quality of the output. But this itself 
 depends on the requirements of the client, in particular (a) the translation aim and (b) the 
 time available. In the case of the printer manual in the scenario above the translation aim 
 was to provide a printer manual in English for export purposes. The fact that the 
 translation was going to be widely distributed outside the organization required it to be of 
 high quality — a correct, well-written and clear piece of English text, which means 
 thorough and conscientious post-editing.
  
 The opposite situation occurs when a rough and ready translation is needed out of some 
 language for personal or internal use, perhaps only to get the gist of some incoming text 
 to see if it looks interesting enough for proper translation. (If it is not, little time or 
 money or effort has been wasted finding out). Here is the sort of scenario in which it 
 might work:
  
 You are an English-speaking agronomist monitoring a stream of infor-
 mation on cereal crop diseases coming in over global computer net-
 works in four different languages. You have a fast MT system which 
 is hooked into the network and translates — extremely badly — from 
 three of the languages into English. Looking at the output and using 
 your experience of the sort of things that reports contain, you should 
 be able to get enough of an idea to know whether to ignore it or pass 
 it on to your specialist translators.
  
 Of course, in this situation it is the speed of the MT system, not its quality that matters —",NA

Summary,"This chapter has given a picture of how MT might be used in an imaginary company, and 
 looked in outline at the typical stages of translation:
  document preparation
 ,
  translation 
 (including various kinds of human involvement and
  interaction
 ), and
  document revision
 , 
 and at the various skills and tools required. In doing this we have tried also to give an 
 idea of some of the different situations in which MT can be useful. In particular, the case 
 of ‘gist’ translation, where speed is important, and quality less important, compared to 
 the case where a translation is intended for widespread publication, and the quality of the 
 finished (post-edited) product is paramount. These are all matters we will return to in the 
 following chapters.",NA

Further Reading,"Descriptions of how MT is actually used in corporate settings can be found in the 
 Proceed-ings of the Aslib Conferences (normally subtitled

 For readers interested in finding out more about the practicalities of pre- and post-editing 
 , there are several relevant contribution in Vasconcellos (1988), in Lawson (1982a). 
 There is a useful discussion of issues in pre-editing and text preparation, in Pym (1990), 
 and we will say more about some related issues in Chapter 8.
  
 An issue that we have not addressed specifically in this chapter is that of machine aids to 
 (human) translation, such as on-line and automatic dictionaries and terminological 
 databases, multilingual word processors, and so on. We will say more about 
 terminological databases in Chapter 5. Relevant discussion of interaction between 
 machine (and machine aided) translation systems and human users can be found in 
 Vasconcellos (1988),Stoll (1988),Knowles (1990) and various papers by Alan Melby, 
 including Melby (1987, 1992), who discusses the idea of a ‘translator’s workbench’. In 
 fact, it should be clear that there is no really hard and fast line that can be drawn between 
 such things and the sort of MT sys-tem we have described here. For one thing, an 
 adequate MT system should clearly include such aids in addition to anything else. In any 
 case, in the kind of setting we have described, there is a sense in which even an MT 
 system which produces very high quality output is really serving as a translators’ aid, 
 since it is helping improve their productivity by pro-ducing draft translations. What are 
 sometimes called distinction between ‘Machine Aided Human Translation’, ‘Human 
 Aided Machine Translation’, and ‘Machine Translation’

 continuum.

Introduction,"In this chapter we will introduce some of the techniques that can be used to represent the 
 kind of information that is needed for translation in such a way that it can be processed 
 automatically. This will provide some necessary background for Chapter 4, where we 
 describe how MT systems actually work.
  
 Human Translators actually deploy at least five distinct kinds of knowledge:
  
 Knowledge of the source language.
  
 Knowledge of the target language. This allows them to produce texts that are ac-
 ceptable in the target language.
  
 Knowledge of various correspondences between source language and target lan-
 guage (at the simplest level, this is knowledge of how individual words can be 
 trans-lated).
  
 Knowledge of the subject matter, including ordinary general knowledge and ‘com-
 mon sense’. This, along with knowledge of the source language, allows them to 
 understand what the text to be translated means.
  
 Knowledge of the culture, social conventions, customs, and expectations, etc. of 
 the speakers of the source and target languages.
  
 This last kind of knowledge is what allows translators to act as genuine mediators, 
 ensuring that the target text genuinely communicates the same sort of message, and has 
 the same sort of impact on the reader, as the source text.

 idea how

 this sort of cultural mediation.

Representing Linguistic Knowledge,"In general, syntax is concerned with two slightly different sorts of analysis of sentences. 
 The first is
  constituent
  or
  phrase structure
  analysis — the division of sentences into 
 their constituent parts and the categorization of these parts as nominal, verbal, and so on. 
 The second is to do with
  grammatical relations
 ; the assignment of grammatical 
 relations such as SUBJECT, OBJECT, HEAD and so on to various parts of the sentence. 
 We will discuss these in turn.
  
 3.2.1 
  
 Grammars and Constituent Structure
  
 Sentences are made up of words, traditionally categorised into
  parts of speech
  or
  cate-
 gories
  including nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs and prepositions (normally 
 abbreviated to N, V, A, ADV, and P). A
  grammar
  of a language is a set of rules which 
 says how these parts of speech can be put together to make grammatical, or ‘well-
 formed’ sentences.
  
 For English, these rules should indicate that (1a) is grammatical, but that (1b) is not (we 
 indicate this by marking it with a ‘*’).
  
 (1)
  
 a.
  
 Put some paper in the printer.
  
 b.
  
 *Printer some put the in paper.
  
 Here are some simple rules for English grammar, with examples. A
  sentence
  consists of 
 a 
 noun phrase
 , such as
  the user
  followed by a
  modal
  or an
  auxiliary verb
 , such as
  
 should
 , followed by a
  verb phrase
 , such as
  clean the printer
 :
  
 (2) The user should clean the printer.
  
 A
  noun phrase
  can consist of a
  determiner
 , or
  article
 , such as
  the
 , or
  a
 , and a
  noun
 , 
 such as
  printer
  (3a). In some circumstances, the determiner can be omitted (3b).
  
 (3)
  
 a.
  
 the printer
  
 b.
  
 printers
  
 ‘Sentence’, is often abbreviated to S, ‘noun phrase’ to NP, ‘verb phrase’ to VP, 
 ‘auxiliary’to AUX, and ‘determiner’ to DET. This information is easily visualized by 
 means of a labelled bracketing of a string of words, as follows, or as a
  tree diagram
 , as 
 in Figure 3.1.

 a. 
  
 b.
  
 Users should clean the printer. 
  
 users 
  
 should
  
 clean

 The auxiliary verb is optional, as can be seen from (5), and the verb phrase can consist of 
 just a verb (such as
  stopped
 ):
  
 (5)
  
 a.
  
 The printer should stop.
  
 b.
  
 The printer stopped.",NA
3.3 Processing,"In the previous sections, we have tried to give an outline of some of the different kinds of 
 knowledge that are needed in text understanding (and hence, translation), and how they 
 can be represented. We will now give an idea of how this knowledge can be manipulated 
 automatically. We will do this in two stages. First, we will look at what is called
  
 analysis
 , or
  parsing
 . This is the process of taking an input string of expressions, and 
 producing representations of the kind we have seen in the previous section. Second, we 
 will look at
  synthesis
 , or
  generation
 , which is the reverse process – taking a 
 representation, and producing the corresponding sentence.
  
 It may be helpful to point out at the beginning that though the representations we have 
 given are generally graphic objects — trees or networks drawn with lines — these are not 
 themselves the representations that the computer deals with. For example, the standard 
 internal representation of a tree is as a
  list
 , containing sublists, with any labels on a node 
 being represented as the first element of the list. If we write lists between ‘(’ and ‘)’, and 
 separate elements with commas, then the tree representation given in Figure 3.1 would 
 look as follows (in fact, we have already shown this sort of representation for linguistic 
 trees).
  
 (S, (NP, (N, users)), (AUX, should), (VP, (V, clean), (NP, (DET, the), (N, printer))))
  
 Lists are one of the datastructures that can be represented and manipulated very easily 
 within a computer.
  
 3.3.1 Parsing
  
 The task of an automatic parser is to take a formal grammar and a sentence and apply the 
 grammar to the sentence in order to (a) check that it is indeed grammatical and (b) given 
 that it is grammatical, show how the words are combined into phrases and how the 
 phrases are put together to form larger phrases (including sentences). So, for example, a 
 parser would use the rules we gave above to check that the sentence
  The temperature has 
 affected the printer
  consists of a noun phrase, consisting of the noun
  Temperature 
 followed by an auxiliary verb, followed by a verb phrase, and that the verb phrase
  
 affected the printer
  consists of the verb
  affect
  and a noun phrase consisting of the noun
  
 printers
 . In effect, this gives the same information as the sorts of tree structure we have 
 given

Introduction,"In Chapter 2, we gave an overview of the environment in which a typical MT system

 discussed how basic linguistic knowledge can be represented and used for automatic 
 analysis and synthesis. It is now time to look inside the most important non-human 
 component in MT— the component that actually performs automatic translation — what 
 we will call the 
 translation engine
 .
  
 MT engines can be classified by their architecture — the overall processing organisation, 
 or the abstract arrangement of its various processing modules. Traditionally, MT has 
 been based on
  direct
  or
  transformer
  architecture engines, and this is still the 
 architecture found in many of the more well-established commercial MT systems. We 
 shall therefore look at this architecture in detail in Section 4.2 before moving on to 
 consider the newer 
 indirect
  or
  linguistic knowledge
  architectures which, having 
 dominated MT research for several years, are starting to become available in commercial 
 form (Section 4.3).",NA
4.2 ,NA,NA
Transformer Architectures,"The main idea behind transformer engines is that input (source language) sentences can 
 be transformed into output (target language) sentences by carrying out the simplest possi-
 ble parse, replacing source words with their target language equivalents as specified in a 
 bilingual dictionary, and then roughly re-arranging their order to suit the rules of the 
 target language. The overall arrangement of such an Engine is shown in Figure 4.1.
  
 The first stage of processing involves the parser, which does some preliminary analysis 
 of the source sentence. The result need not be a complete representation of the kind de-
 scribed in Chapter 3, but might just be a list of words with their parts of speech. This is 
 passed to a package of rules which transform the sentence into a target sentence, using

Linguistic Knowledge Architectures,"The second major architecture —
  indirect
  or
  linguistic knowledge
  (LK) architecture —
 has dominated research in MT design during the past decade and is starting to appear in a 
 number of commercial systems. The idea behind LK engines is straightforward enough:
  
 High quality MT requires linguistic knowledge of
  both
  the source and the 
 target languages as well as the differences between them.
  
 We use the term ‘linguistic knowledge’ to refer to extensive formal grammars which 
 permit abstract/relatively deep analyses in the sense of Chapter 3. We shall see later on 
 just how deep the analysis can go.
  
 With the Transformer architecture, the translation process relies on some knowledge of 
 the source language and some knowledge about how to transform partly analysed source 
 sentences into strings that look like target language sentences. With the LK architecture, 
 on the other hand, translation relies on extensive knowledge of both the source
  and
  the 
 target languages and of the relationships between analysed sentences in both languages. 
 In short, LK architecture typically accords the target language the same status as the 
 source language. As can be seen from Figure 4.2, the LK architecture requires two 
 things:
  
 A substantial grammar of both the source language and the target language. These 
 grammars are used by parsers to analyse sentences in each language into represen-
 tations which show their underlying structure, and by generators to produce output 
 sentences from such representations.

Introduction,"This Chapter is about the role played by dictionaries in MT. Our decision to devote a 
 whole chapter to this discussion reflects the importance of dictionaries in MT:
  
 Dictionaries are the largest components of an MT system in terms of the amount of 
 information they hold. If they are more then simple word lists (and they should be, 
 if a system is to perform well), then they may well be the most expensive 
 components to construct.
  
 More than any other component, the size and quality of the dictionary limits the 
 scope and coverage of a system, and the quality of translation that can be expected.
  
 The dictionaries are where the end user can expect to be able to contribute most to 
 a system — in fact, an end user can expect to have to make some additions to 
 system dictionaries to make a system really useful. While MT suppliers rarely 
 make it possible for users to modify other components, they normally expect them 
 to make additions to the dictionary. Thus, from the point of view of a user, a basic 
 understanding of dictionary construction and sensitivity to the issues involved 
 in‘describing words’ is an important asset.
  
 In discussing dictionaries here, we include also some discussion of terminology —
 it is with respect to the treatment of terminology that MT provides some of its most 
 useful benefits.
  
 We shall approach the question of dictionaries in MT obliquely, by considering in some 
 detail the information contained in, and issues raised by, the paper dictionaries with 
 which we are all familiar. There are a number of reasons for this, but the most important 
 is that the dictionaries in existing MT systems are diverse in terms of formats, coverage, 
 level
  
 83",NA
5.2 Paper Dictionaries,"The best place to start our discussion is by looking at typical entries that one might find in 
 a monolingual English dictionary (cf. page 89), and a bilingual dictionary (cf. page 90).
 2
  
 We will start by looking at the layout of the first half of the monolingual entry. The entry
  
 1
 ‘Paper’ here is intended to convey ‘intended for human readers’, as opposed to ‘electronic’ 
 meaning‘intended for use by computers’. Of course, it is possible for a paper dictionary to be stored on a 
 computer like any other document, and our use of ‘paper’ here is not supposed to exclude this. If one were 
 being precise, one should distinguish ‘paper’ dictionaries, ‘machine readable’ dictionaries (conventional 
 dictionaries which are stored on, and can therefore be accessed automatically by computer), and ‘machine
  
 usable
  dictionaries’.
  
 2
 The form of the monolingual entry is based on that used in the
  Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary 
 (OALD); the bilingual entry is similar to what one finds in
  Collins-Robert English-French dictionary.
  
 84",NA
5.3 ,NA,NA
Types of Word Information,"We have already observed that dictionaries are a, perhaps
  the
 , central component of MT 
 systems. In earlier Chapters, we have presented a highly simplified view of dictionaries 
 —for example, in Chapter 3 the dictionary was sometimes little more than a list of rules 
 such as
  v 
  
 walk
 , which only allows 
 information about part of speech to be represented, and in Chapter 4 we gave translation 
 rules which simply paired up the citation forms of source and target words (e.g.
  
 temperature temperatur
 ). However, though some of the information that is 
 found in a typical paper dictionary is of limited value in MT (e.g. information about 
 pronunciation is only useful in speech to speech systems), in general the quality and 
 detail of the information one needs for MT is at least equal to that which one finds in 
 paper dictionaries. In this section we discuss the various pieces of information about 
 words that a good MT system must contain, basing ourselves on the dictionary entries 
 above. An issue we will not address in this Chapter is the treatment of idioms, which one 
 typically finds in paper dictionary entries. We discuss the treatment of idioms in Chapter 
 6.
  
 It is useful to make a distinction between the characteristics of a word itself (its inherent 
 properties) and the restrictions it places on other words in its grammatical environment. 
 Although this distinction is not explicitly drawn in paper dictionaries, information of 
 both types is available in them. Information about grammatical properties includes the 
 indica-tion of gender in the French part of the bilingual dictionary entry, and the 
 indication of number on nouns (typically, the citation form of nouns is the singular form, 
 and informa-tion about number is only explicitly given for nouns which have only plural 
 forms, such as
  scissors
 , and
  trousers
 ).
  
 Information about the grammatical environment a word can appear in is normally 
 thought of as dividing into two kinds:
  subcategorization
  information, which indicates 
 the syn-tactic environments that a word can occur in, and
  selectional restrictions
  which 
 describe semantic properties of the environment. Typical information about 
 subcategorization is the information that
  button
  is a transitive verb. This is expressed in 
 the verb code [Tn] in the dictionary entry on page 89. More precisely, this indicates that 
 it is a verb that appears as the HEAD of sentences with a (noun phrase) SUBJECT and a 
 (noun phrase) OBJECT. The following gives some examples, together with the 
 appropriate verb codes from OALD:
  
 years to construct even a small size dictionary. Of course, the time it takes to write a dictionary entry is very 
 variable, depending on how much of the work has already been done by other lexicographers.

 In fact, it is arguable that the vocabulary of a language like English, with relatively productive morpho-
 logical processes, is infinite, in the sense that there is no longest word of the language. Even the supposedly 
 longest word
  antidisestablishmentarianism
  can be made longer by adding a prefix such as
  crypto-
 , or a suffix 
 such as
  -ist
 . The result may not be pretty, but it is arguably a possible word of English. The point is even 
 clearer when one considers compound words (see Section 5.4.3.",NA
5.4 ,NA,NA
Dictionaries and Morphology,"Morphology is concerned with the internal structure of words, and how words can be 
 formed. It is usual to recognize three different word formation processes.
  
 93",NA
5.5 ,NA,NA
Terminology,"The discussion so far has been about issues relating to general vocabulary. However, a 
 slightly different, and somewhat less troublesome, set of issues arise when one turns to 
 the specialist vocabulary that one finds in certain types of text in certain subject fields 
 (the vocabulary of weather reports is an extreme example, other examples might be the 
 vocabulary of reports on trials for medical reports, reports of tests of pharmaceutical 
 drugs, or reports of particular kinds of sporting event). Such fields often have a relatively 
 well-defined terminology, which is sometimes even codified, and given official 
 recognition by professional bodies. What this codification involves is settling on a 
 collection of concepts, and assigning each a name (or perhaps several names, one in each 
 of several languages). When a word (or collection of words in several languages) 
 designate a single concept in this way, it is called a term. Examples of terms include the 
 names for material objects, but also the abstract entities (processes, properties, functions, 
 etc). Concepts, and hence the associated terms, can be organized into conceptual 
 structures, based on the relationship between them. For example tables, chairs, 
 cupboards, etc. can be grouped together as 
 furniture
 , with a possible subdivision into
  
 household furniture
  and
  office furniture
 .
  
 Terms may be simple words or multiword expressions. Syntactically, there is nothing to 
 distinguish terms from ordinary language, although there is a strong tendency for terms 
 to be nouns, often compound nouns.
  
 Terms are potentially more tractable for MT systems than general language vocabulary, 
 since for the most part they tend to be less ambiguous. While a general language word 
 may represent more than one concept in a system of concepts, there is frequently a one-
 to-one mapping between terms and the concepts they represent. Take for example the 
 word 
 graduation
 , which in machine tool terminology has the very precise meaning: 
 “distribution of divisions on the scale of an apparatus (linear, logarithmic, quadratic, 
 etc)” The general language word
  graduation
 , on the other hand, has many more 
 meanings, including “the ceremony at which degrees are conferred”. What this means, of 
 course, is that one can in principle adopt an interlingual approach to terminology. For 
 example, even in a transfer",NA
5.6 Summary,"This Chapter has dealt with a number of issues concerning dictionaries in MT, includ-ing 
 issues relating to various kinds of word structure (morphology), and terminology. Apart 
 from stressing their importance, we have outlined the main sorts of information that one 
 typically finds in dictionaries, and raised some questions about how this information 
 should be represented.",NA
5.7 Further Reading,"A readable account of what is involved in producing a dictionary can be found in Sinclair 
 (1987) — in this case the dictionary is monolingual, and intended for human readers, but 
 many of the issues are similar. A general discussion of what are taken to be the main 
 theoretical issues in the design and construction of dictionaries for NLP purposes is given 
 in Ritchie (1987).
  
 On morphology, Spencer (1991) provides an excellent up-to-date description of current 
 linguistic theory. For a more extensive discussion of compounding see Bauer (1983). A 
 detailed description of the state of the art as regards computational treatments of mor-
 phological phenomena is given in Ritchie et al. (1992). Almost the only discussion of 
 morphology which is specifically related to MT is Bennett (1993).
  
 For a general introduction to the study of terminology, see Sager (1990), on termbanks, 
 see Bennett et al. (1986); McNaught (1988b, forthcoming, 1988a). For discussion of 
 com-puterized termbanks and translation, see Thomas (1992). Experience of using a 
 termino-logical database in the translation process is reported in Paillet (1990).
  
 These days, many paper dictionaries exist in machine readable form (i.e. they have been 
 created as ‘electronic documents’ in the sense of Chapter 8, below). OALD, the Oxford 
 Advanced Learners’ Dictionary Hornby et al. (1974), from which the monolingual entry 
 on page 89 is taken, and LDOCE, Longman’s Dictionary of Contemporary English 
 Proctor (1978), are typical in this respect. They are sufficiently consistent and explicit to 
 have been used in a number of experiments which try to take ‘paper’ dictionaries (or 
 rather the machine readable versions of them), and convert them into a form which can 
 be used directly in NLP systems. Some of this work is reported in Boguraev and Briscoe 
 (1989).
  
 The representation and use of lexical information in NLP is the focus of a great deal of 
 research currently. Some idea of the range of this can be obtained from Evens (1988) and 
 Pustejovsky and 
  
 Bergler (1992). 
  
 The 
  
 idea of 
  
 structuring 
  
 a dictionary 
 hierarchically so that individual entries can inherit information (and so be simplified), 
 which we mentioned briefly, is particularly important in this research. A clearer idea of 
 what is involved can be gained from (Pollard and Sag, 1987, Chapter 8).

Translation Problems,NA,NA
6.1 ,NA,NA
Introduction,"In this chapter we will consider some particular problems which the task of translation 
 poses for the builder of MT systems — some of the reasons why MT is hard. It is useful 
 to think of these problems under two headings: (i) Problems of
  ambiguity
 , (ii) problems 
 that arise from
  structural
  and
  lexical differences
  between languages and (iii) multiword 
 units like idioms and collocations. We will discuss typical problems of ambiguity in 
 Section 6.2, lexical and structural mismatches in Section 6.3, and multiword units in 
 Section 6.4.
  
 Of course, these sorts of problem are not the only reasons why MT is hard. Other 
 problems include the sheer size of the undertaking, as indicated by the number of rules 
 and dictionary entries that a realistic system will need, and the fact that there are many 
 constructions whose grammar is poorly understood, in the sense that it is not clear how 
 they should be represented, or what rules should be used to describe them. This is the 
 case even for English, which has been extensively studied, and for which there are 
 detailed descriptions– both traditional ‘descriptive’ and theoretically sophisticated – 
 some of which are written with computational usability in mind. It is an even worse 
 problem for other languages. Moreover, even where there is a reasonable description of a 
 phenomenon or construction, producing a description which is sufficiently precise to be 
 used by an automatic system raises non-trivial problems.",NA
6.2 ,NA,NA
Ambiguity,"In the best of all possible worlds (as far as most Natural Language Processing is 
 concerned, anyway) every word would have one and only one meaning. But, as we all 
 know, this is not the case. When a word has more than one meaning, it is said to be
  
 lexically ambiguous
 . When a phrase or sentence can have more than one structure it is 
 said to be
  structurally ambiguous
 .
  
 105",NA
6.3 ,NA,NA
Lexical and Structural Mismatches,"At the start of the previous section we said that, in the best of all possible worlds for 
 NLP, every word would have exactly one sense. While this is true for most NLP, it is an 
 exaggeration as regards MT. It would be a
  better
  world, but not the best of all possible 
 worlds, because we would still be faced with difficult translation problems. Some of 
 these problems are to do with lexical differences between languages — differences in the 
 ways in which languages seem to classify the world, what concepts they choose to 
 express by single words, and which they choose not to lexicalize. We will look at some 
 of these directly. Other problems arise because different languages use different 
 structures for the same purpose, and the same structure for different purposes. In either 
 case, the result is that we have to complicate the translation process. In this section we 
 will look at some representative examples.
  
 Examples like the ones in (9) below are familiar to translators, but the examples of 
 colours (9c), and the Japanese examples in (9d) are particularly striking. The latter 
 because they show how languages need differ not only with respect to the fineness or 
 ‘granularity’ of the distinctions they make, but also with respect to the basis for the 
 distinction: English chooses different verbs for the action/event of putting on, and the 
 action/state of wearing. Japanese does not make this distinction, but differentiates 
 according to the object that is worn. In the case of English to Japanese, a fairly simple 
 test on the semantics of the NPs that accompany a verb may be sufficient to decide on the 
 right translation. Some of the colour examples are similar, but more generally, 
 investigation of colour vocabulary indicates that languages actually carve up the 
 spectrum in rather different ways, and that deciding on the best translation may require 
 knowledge that goes well beyond what is in the text, and may even be undecidable. In 
 this sense, the translation of colour terminology begins to resemble the translation of 
 terms for cultural artifacts (e.g. words like English 
 cottage
 , Russian
  dacha
 , French
  
 chˆateau
 , etc. for which no adequate translation exists, and for which the human 
 translator must decide between straight borrowing, neologism, and

 *The man that I wonder who (he) has seen was arrested.",NA
Multiword units: Idioms and Collocations,"Roughly speaking,
  idioms
  are expressions whose meaning cannot be completely under-
 stood from the meanings of the component parts. For example, whereas it is possible to 
 work out the meaning of (19a) on the basis of knowledge of English grammar and the 
 meaning of words, this would not be sufficient to work out that (19b) can mean 
 something like ‘If Sam dies, her children will be rich’. This is because
  kick the bucket
  is 
 an idiom.
  
 (19)
  
 a.
  
 If Sam mends the bucket, her children will be rich.
  
 b.
  
 If Sam kicks the bucket, her children will be rich.
  
 The problem with idioms, in an MT context, is that it is not usually possible to translate 
 them using the normal rules. There are exceptions, for example
  take the bull by the horns 
 (meaning ‘face and tackle a difficulty without shirking’) can be translated literally into 
 French as
  prendre le taureau par les cornes
 , which has the same meaning. But, for the 
 most part, the use of normal rules in order to translate idioms will result in nonsense. 
 Instead, one has to treat idioms as single units in translation.
  
 In many cases, a natural translation for an idiom will be a single word — for example, 
 the French word
  mourir
  (‘die’) is a possible translation for
  kick the bucket
 . This brings 
 out the similarity, which we noted above, with lexical holes of the kind shown in (20).",NA
6.5 Summary,"This chapter looks at some problems which face the builder of MT systems. We charac-
 terized them as problems of ambiguity (lexical and syntactic) and problems of lexical and 
 structural mismatches. We saw how different types of linguistic and non-linguistic 
 knowl-edge are necessary to resolve problems of ambiguity, and in the next chapter we 
 examine in more detail how to represent this knowledge. In this chapter we discussed 
 instances of lexical and structural mismatches and the problem of non-compositionality 
 (as exempli-fied by idioms and collocations) and looked at some strategies for dealing 
 with them in MT systems.

 The problem of ambiguity is pervasive in NLP, and is discussed extensively in the 
 introduc-tions to the subject such as those mentioned in the Further Reading section of 
 Chapter 3.
  
 Examples of lexical and structural mismatches are discussed in (Hutchins and Somers, 
 1992, Chapter 6). Problems of the
  venir-de
 /
 have just
  sort are discussed extensively in the 
 MT literature. A detailed discussion of the problem can be found in Arnold et al. (1988), 
 and in Sadler (1993). On light verbs or support verbs, see Danlos and Samvelian (1992); 
 Danlos (1992).
  
 Treatments of idioms in MT are given in Arnold and Sadler (1989), and Schenk (1986). 
 On collocations, see for example Allerton (1984), Benson et al. (1986a), Benson et al. 
 (1986b) and Hanks and Church (1989). The notion of
  lexical functions
  is due to 
 Mel’ˇcuk, see for example Mel’ˇcuk and Polguere (1987); Mel’ˇcuk and Zholkovsky 
 (1988).
  
 A classic discussion of translation problems is Vinay and Darbelnet (1977). This is 
 concerned with translation problems as faced by humans, rather than machines, but it 
 points out several of the problems mentioned here.
  
 The discussion in this chapter touches on two issues of general linguistic and 
 philosophical interest: to what extent human languages really do carve the world up 
 differently, and whether there are some sentences in some languages which cannot be 
 translated into other languages. As regards the first question, it seems as though there are 
 some limits. For example, though languages carve the colour spectrum up rather 
 differently, so there can be rather large differences between colour words in terms of their 
 extensions, there seems to be a high level of agreement about ‘best instances’. That is, 
 though the extension of English
  red
 , and Japanese
  akai
  is different, nevertheless, the 
 colour which is regarded as the best instance of
  red
  by English speakers is the colour 
 which is regarded as the best instance of
  akai
  by Japanese speakers. The seminal work on 
 this topic is Berlin and Kay (1969), 
  
 and see the title essay of Pullum (1991). The 
 second question is sometimes referred to as the question of
  effability
 , see Katz (1978); 
 Keenan (1978) for relevant discussion.",NA

Introduction,"The discussion in previous chapters reinforces the point made in Chapter 3 about the 
 value of syntactic, and ‘shallow’ semantic analysis, but it also shows why performing a 
 syntactic analysis alone is not sufficient for translation. As the discussion in Chapter 6 
 indicates, there are many cases where problems seem to require deeper, more meaning 
 oriented representations, and enrichment of the kind of knowledge systems are equipped 
 with. In this chapter we will try to give a flavour of what is involved in this.
  
 It is useful to think of this knowledge as being of three kinds: (i) linguistic knowledge 
 which is independent of context, semantic knowledge; (ii) linguistic knowledge which 
 relates to the context (e.g. of earlier utterances), sometimes called pragmatic knowledge; 
 and (iii) common sense, general, non-linguistic knowledge about the real world, which 
 we will call real world knowledge. It should be stressed that the distinction between these 
 different kinds of knowledge is not always clear, and there are those who would dispute 
 whether the distinction is real. However, it is at least a convenient subdivision of the 
 field, and we will examine each sort of knowledge in turn, in Sections 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4. 
 Discussing these different kinds of knowledge will also allow us to describe some more 
 general translation problems.
  
 Apart from giving an overview and flavour of what is involved, the point we would like 
 to stress in this chapter is that though dealing with meaning in a general way poses many 
 unsolved problems, and in general one should not expect to find much in the way of real 
 world, pragmatic, or even semantic processing in current commercial MT systems, such 
 processing it is not
  totally
  beyond the reach of current theory.
  
 123",NA
7.2 Semantics,"Semantics is concerned with the meaning of words and how they combine to form 
 sentence meanings. It is useful to distinguish
  lexical
  semantics, and
  structural
  semantics 
 — the former is to do with the meanings of words, the latter to do with the meanings of 
 phrases, including sentences. We will begin with the former.
  
 There are many ways of thinking about and representing word meanings, but one that has 
 proved useful in the field of machine translation involves associating words with
  seman-
 tic features
  which correspond to their sense components. For example, the words
  man
 , 
 woman
 ,
  boy
 , and
  girl
  might be represented as:
  
 man = (+HUMAN, +MASCULINE and +ADULT)
  
 woman = (+HUMAN, -MASCULINE and +ADULT)
  
 boy = (+HUMAN, +MASCULINE and -ADULT)
  
 girl = (+HUMAN, -MASCULINE and -ADULT)
  
 Associating words with semantic features is useful because some words impose semantic 
 constraints on what other kinds of words they can occur with. For example, the verb
  eat 
 demands that its AGENT (the eater) is animate and that its PATIENT (that which is 
 eaten) is edible, — concrete (rather than abstract, like sincerity, or beauty), and solid 
 (rather than liquid, so one cannot ‘eat’ beer, coffee, etc.; soup is a borderline case). We 
 can encode this constraint in our grammar by associating the features HUMAN and 
 EDIBLE with appropriate nouns in our dictionary and describing our entry for
  eat
  as 
 something like
  cat=verb, AGENT=HUMAN, PATIENT=EDIBLE
 . The grammar 
 will now only accept objects of
  eat
  that have the feature EDIBLE. Thus these
  selectional 
 restrictions
 , as they are called, act as a filter on our grammar to rule out unwanted 
 analyses. Consider sentence (1):
  
 (1) 
  
 John ate the game.
  
 The English word
  game
  is ambiguous - it can mean several things, including
  a form of 
 play or sport
  or
  a wild animal hunted or fished for food
 . Using selectional restrictions of 
 the sort described above we can eliminate the ‘form of play or sport’ meaning if the 
 system is able to infer that ‘food’ is EDIBLE, but that forms of play are not.
  
 Selectional restrictions have proved a very useful device and are found in most MT 
 systems to a greater or lesser extent. Unfortunately, however, exceptions to selectional 
 restrictions abound, especially in metaphorical speech. Thus we find sentences like
  This 
 car eats money
 , used to mean that the car is expensive to maintain, so, rather than use 
 selectional restrictions to eliminate interpretations, we should use them to state
  
 preferences
  between alternative interpretations.

7.3 ,NA,NA
Pragmatics ,"Recall that we made a distinction between semantics, or context-independent meaning, 
 and pragmatics, or context-dependent meaning. The term ‘context’ is used ambiguously, 
 to refer to the rest of the text in which a sentence occurs (sometimes referred to as the 
 discourse), and to circumstances external to the text itself, such as who the author of the 
 text is, and the social setting in which it occurs, which also contribute to its interpretation. 
 To see why the discourse is important, let us consider the translation of
  anaphoric pro-
 nouns
 . Anaphoric pronouns are those which refer back to some
  antecedent
  earlier in the 
 text, as the pronoun
  it
  in (13) refers back to its antecedent
  the cake
 .
  
 (13) Sam took the cake from the table. Then he ate it.
  
 Take the translation of (13) from English into French. We know that
  it
  must refer back to

7.4 Real World Knowledge,"The above discussion may lead one to suspect that all the knowledge we need to extract 
 the meaning from texts and translate them can be got from the texts or their contexts. 
 This is, however, clearly not the case, as the following classic examples show:
  
 (18)
  
 a.
  
 Little Johnny was very upset. He had lost his toy train. Then he found it. It
  
 2
 Politeness dictates that giving by the hearer to the speaker is normally giving ‘downwards’ (
 kureru
 ), so 
 this is the verb used to describe requests, and giving by the speaker to the hearer is normally giving 
 ‘upwards’(
 ageru
 ), so this is the verb used to describe offers, etc.

Summary,"In this chapter we have looked at three kinds of knowledge that seem to be involved in 
 solving some sorts of translation problems, namely: semantic, pragmatic, and real world 
 knowledge. Particular problems we have looked at include the translation of prepositions, 
 of tense and aspect, and of pronouns. As we stated at the beginning of the chapter, the 
 point to stress as regards such knowledge is that its representation and manipulation pose 
 many unsolved problems, and one should not expect to find techniques which exploit it 
 in existing commercial MT systems (it follows that, for the most part, existing commer-
 cial MT systems may be expected to lack adequate or general treatments of the sorts of 
 problem which require such knowledge). On the other hand, such processing is not
  
 totally 
 beyond the reach of current theory. In particular, within certain limits, and in 
 restricted domains, techniques of semantic, pragmatic, and ‘real world’ knowledge 
 processing can be exploited with some success.

7.6 Further Reading,"Introductions to linguistic semantics include Hurford and Heasley (1983); Kempson 
 (1977), and, at a rather more advanced level Cann (1993); Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet 
 (1990).
  
 The discussion of tense and aspect given here is inspired by that used in the EUROTRA 
 project, which is described in Allegranza et al. (1991); Van Eynde (1993a). This, in its 
 turn, is inspired by the work of Bruce (1972), and ultimately Reichenbach (1947).
  
 As regards pragmatics, Levinson (1983); Leech (1983) are useful introductions. Relevant 
 work on discourse structure includes Grosz and Sidner (1986); Pustejovsky (1987). The 
 treatment of common sense inference and real world knowledge is the field of Artificial 
 Intelligence, see for example Rich (1983); Tennant (1981); Barr and Fiegenbaum (1981); 
 Shapiro (1987).

 this Chapter is rather that suggested by the programming language Prolog. For an easy

Introduction,"In the scenario we imagined in Chapter 2, the text was delivered in the form of a 
 machine-readable document, having been prepared in such a way as to facilitate 
 translation. This is an important time saver. In this chapter, we describe how the full 
 potential of machine readable texts can be exploited in three ways: first, by adopting the 
 notion of an ‘electronic document’ and embedding an MT system in a complete 
 document processing system; second, by restricting the form of input by using simplified 
 or
  controlled language
 ; and third, by restricting both the form, and the subject matter of 
 the input texts to those that fall within a
  sublanguage
  — it is here that the immediate 
 prospects for MT are greatest. The common theme of this chapter is how the successful 
 application of MT can be enhanced by ensuring that the input to the system is 
 ‘appropriate’. Briefly, the message is this: having texts in machine readable form is a 
 prerequisite for sensible use of MT, but one can get much better results by (i) adopting 
 certain standard formats for the input, (ii) controlling the input, so that problematic 
 constructions, etc., are avoided, and (iii) where possible, tailoring the MT systems to the 
 language of particular domains.",NA
8.2 ,NA,NA
The Electronic Document,"8.2.1 
  
 Basic Ideas
  
 Every text that is not delivered as an electronic document on a floppy disc, a magnetic 
 tape, or via a computer network will have to be put into the system manually. Re-typing a 
 text into the computer solely to make it available for MT is unlikely to be cost-
 effective— it would often be quicker to have the text translated directly by a human 
 translator. In recent years it has become practicable to use an optical character reader 
 (OCR) to input text available only in printed form. Clearly this is much quicker than re-
 typing, but checking for and correcting scanning errors can be time-consuming.
  
 139",NA
8.3 ,NA,NA
Controlled Languages,"The notion of controlled languages was introduced in Chapter 2 where we described it as 
 a form of language usage restricted by grammar and vocabulary rules. The original idea 
 arose during the 1930s, when a number of influential linguists and scholars devoted 
 considerable effort to establishing a ‘minimal’ variety of English, a variety specifically 
 designed to make English accessible to and usable by the largest possible number of 
 people world wide.
  Basic English
 , as it was called, differed from previous attempts to 
 construct universal languages in that it was a perfectly well-formed part of English, 
 rather than some entirely artificial or hybrid construction such as Esperanto. One of the 
 central ideas of the Basic English movement was that the number of general-purpose 
 words needed for writing anything from a simple letter of receipt through to a major 
 speech on the world economic situation could be a few hundred rather than the 75 000 
 upward available to skilled native speakers. This lexical economy was to be achieved in 
 part by using ‘operator verbs’ with the set of nouns and adjectives to stand in for the vast 
 number of derived verbs which are frequently used. For example, whereas in ordinary 
 English we might write
  The disc controller design was perfected over numerous 
 revisions
 , Basic English would say ...
  was made perfect ...,
  where
  make
  is one of the 
 operator verbs and
  perfect
  one of the licensed Basic English adjectives.
  
 The authors of Basic English explicitly recognised that the dictionary would need to be 
 extended with special terminology for scientific and technical writing. However, even if 
 a text contained terminology specific to a certain subject field, the general language

8.4 Sublanguage MT,"In the previous section, we looked at a method of controlling the input to an MT sys-tem, 
 simplifying it by avoiding certain uses of words, and avoiding potentially ambiguous 
 constructions. Since the success of the METEO MT system, which we mentioned briefly 
 in Chapter 1, an important strand of MT has involved concentrating on what we could 
 loosely call ‘MT for Special Purpose Languages’, or sublanguage MT. Here, rather than 
 imposing controls or simplifications on writers, one tries to exploit the restrictions in 
 terms
  
 150",NA
8.5 Summary,"In this chapter we have discussed three ways in which one can increase the likelihood of 
 MT being successful by taking care with the input to the system. We first concentrated 
 on the importance of integrating MT into the general document preparation environment, 
 introducing the notion of the electronic document. We stressed the importance of 
 standards in the encoding of texts, and showed how the process of MT can be aided by 
 the adoption of the SGML markup language. In the following section, we turned to the 
 content of texts themselves and introduced the notion of controlled languages, in which 
 one adopts a simplified form of the language in order to communicate simply and 
 unambiguously with the reader. Using a controlled language input greatly enhances the 
 quality of output of MT systems. Finally we discussed sublanguage MT, or MT in 
 restricted domains, observing that the language used in specialized technical domains is 
 often quite different from and more restricted in style and content than the ‘general 
 language’, and it is possible to take advantage of these characteristics by tailoring an MT 
 system to the language of particular domains.

 SGML is defined in ISO 8879, 1986, which is extensively discussed in the standard 
 refer-ence book on SGML: Goldfarb (1986). An excellent introduction to SGML is 
 provided in van Herwijnen (1990).
  
 The examples of the use of controlled language that we give in the text are based on 
 those in Pym (1990). See Pym (1990); Newton (1992b) for discussion of the use of 
 PACE as part of the translation operation in Perkins.
  
 A noteworthy example of a controlled language is
  Simplified English
  (SE), which is de-
 scribed in the
  AECMA/AIA Simplified English Guide
  AECMA. This grew out of work 
 done in the late 1970s, on behalf of the Association of European Airlines (AECMA) into 
 readability of maintenance documentation within the civilian aircraft industry. As a 
 result, an AECMA working group researched the procedural texts in maintenance 
 manuals. It contains a limited general vocabulary of about 1500 words and a set of 
 Writing Rules, similar to those we will describe above.
  
 On sublanguage, Arnold (1990) provides a short overview. Lehrberger (1982) and Grish-
 man and Kittredge (1986) are collections of articles on the subject. More detailed discus-
 sions can be found in Kittredge (1982), Kittredge (1987), Sager (1982), Slocum (1986),

Evaluating MT Systems,NA,NA
9.1 ,NA,NA
Introduction,"How can you tell if an MT system is ‘good’? How can you tell which of two systems 
 is‘better’? What do ‘good’ and ‘better’ mean in this context? These are the questions that 
 this chapter tries to answer.
  
 In a practical domain like MT, such questions reduce to questions of suitability to 
 users’needs: what is the best and most economical way to deal with the user’s translation 
 re-quirements? In the ideal case, it should be possible to give a simple and 
 straightforward answer to this question in a consumers’ magazine. An article in such a 
 magazine would discuss the most important issues with a comparison table displaying the 
 achievements of different MT systems on tests of important aspects such as speed and 
 quality. Unfortu-nately, the information necessary to make informed judgements is not so 
 readily available, partly because the methods for investigating suitability are not well 
 developed. In reality, MT users can spend quite a lot of money finding out what a system 
 can and cannot do for them. In this chapter we will look at the kind of thing that should 
 matter to potential users of MT systems, and then discuss some existing methods for 
 assessing MT system performance.
  
 As we pointed out in the Introduction (Chapter 1), we think that, in the short term, MT is 
 likely to be of most benefit to largish corporate organizations doing a lot of translation. 
 So we adopt this perspective here. However, most of the considerations apply to any 
 potential user.",NA
9.2 ,NA,NA
Some Central Issues,"The evaluation of MT systems is a complex task. This is not only because many different 
 factors are involved, but because measuring translation performance is itself difficult. 
 The first important step for a potential buyer is to determine the translational needs of her
  
 157",NA
9.3 Evaluation of Engine Performance,"Substantial long-term experience with particular MT systems in particular circumstances 
 shows that productivity improvements and cost-savings actually achieved can be very 
 vari-able. Not all companies can apply MT as successfully as the following:
  
 In the 1980s, Perkins Engines was achieving reported cost savings of 
 around
  £
 4000 for each diesel engine user manual translated on a PC-
 based WEIDNER MT system. Moreover, overall translation time per 
 manual was more than halved from around 26 weeks to 9-12 weeks. 
 Manuals were written in Perkins Approved Clear English (cf. Chap-ter 
 8).(Pym, 1990, pages 91-2)
  
 Different organizations experience different results with MT. The above examples 
 indicate that the kind of input text is one of the important factors for getting good results. 
 A sound system evaluation is therefore one which is executed within the company itself. 
 An MT vendor might provide you with translated material which shows what their 
 system can do. There is, however, no guarantee that the system will do the same in a 
 different company setting, with different texts. Only a company specific evaluation will 
 provide the client with the feedback she ultimately wants. Information provided by the 
 MT vendor can be useful though, e.g. if system specifications indicate what sort of text 
 type it can or cannot handle or what sort of language constructions are problematic for 
 their system.
  
 In evaluating MT systems one should also take into account the fact that system perfor-
 mance will normally improve considerably during the first few months after its 
 installation, as the system is tuned to the source materials, as discussed in Chapter 2. It 
 follows that performance on an initial trial with a sample of the sort of material to be 
 translated can only be broadly indicative of the translation quality that might ultimately 
 be achieved after several months or years of work.
  
 Something similar holds for those stages of the translation process which involve the 
 trans-lator, like dictionary updating and post-editing of the output. Times needed for 
 these tasks will reduce as translators gain experience.
  
 So how do we evaluate a system? Early evaluation studies were mainly concerned with

 It is true that a comparative evaluation of a number of different MT systems might 
 demon-strate that one system is in all respects better than the others. The information 
 however does not tell us whether buying the better MT system will improve the total 
 translation process — the system could still be unprofitable. And even if two particular 
 systems have different performance profiles, it may not always be clear whether one 
 profile is likely to be better matched to the task in hand than the other. For example, look 
 at the intelligibility ratings for systems A and B in Figure 9.2. For system A the majority 
 of sentences are neither very good nor bad (rating 3 or 4). System B, by comparison, 
 tends to do either quite well (scores of 7 are common) or quite badly (scores 1, and 2 are 
 frequent). Which system will be better in practice? It is not possible to say.

  Which Performance Curve is Better?
  
 take the raw translation we were using in the scenario in Chapter 2 as an example, error 
 analysis might work as follows.
  
 For the example three sorts of error are identified. These three sorts are errors involving 
 selection of
  a
  vs
  one
  as the translation of German
  ein
 , errors in number agreement (e.g. 
 *
 a computers
 ), and errors in the selection of prepositions. Using some short codes for 
 each error type, each error occurrence is marked up in the raw output. The resulting 
 marked text is given below.
  
 To calculate the seriousness of the errors, weights in the range 0 to 1 are assigned to the 
 three error types. The weight for an error in preposition selection is higher than that for 
 incorrect number because the person responsible considers that incorrect number is 
 relatively less serious. This is summarized in the following table.
  
 ERROR TYPE 
  
 a
 /
 one
  selection 
  
 Number 
  
 Preposition
  
 WEIGHT 
  
 0.4 
  
 0.2 
  
 0.6
  
 On the basis of this the total error score can be calculated. There are two errors in 
 NUMber agreement, two involving PREPositions, and one involving A/ONE selection, 
 so the score is:
  
 Although this method gives more direct information on the usefulness of an MT system, 
 there are immediate problems with using detailed error analysis. The first is practical: it

9.4 Operational Evaluation,"In the previous sections we have discussed various types of quality assessment. One 
 mayor disadvantage of quality assessment for MT evaluation purposes, however, is the 
 fact the overall performance of an MT system has to be judged on more aspects than 
 translation quality only. The most complete and direct way to determine whether MT 
 performs well in a given set of circumstances is to carry out an operational evaluation on 
 site comparing the combined MT and post-editing costs with those associated with pure 
 human translation. The requirement here is that the vendor allows the potential buyer to 
 test the MT system in her particular translation environment. Because of the enormous 
 investment that buying a system often represents, vendors should allow a certain test 
 period. During an operational evaluation a record is kept of all the user’s costs, the 
 translation times and other relevant aspects. This evaluation technique is ideal in the 
 sense that it gives the user direct informa-tion on how MT would fit in and change the 
 existing translation environment and whether it would be profitable.
  
 Before starting up the MT evaluation the user should have a clear picture of the costs that 
 are involved in the current set-up with human translation. When this information on the 
 cost of the current translation service is available the MT experiment can begin.
  
 In an operational evaluation of MT time plays an important role. Translators need to be 
 paid and the more time they spend on post-editing MT output and updating the system’s 
 dictionaries, the less profitable MT will be. In order to get a realistic idea of the time 
 needed for such translator tasks they need to receive proper training prior to the exper-
 iment. Also, the MT system needs to be tuned towards the texts it is supposed to deal 
 with.
  
 During an evaluation period lasting several months it should be possible to fully cost the 
 use of MT, and at the end of the period, comparison with the costs of human translation 
 should indicate whether, in the particular circumstances, MT would be profitable in 
 finan-cial terms or not.

Summary,"The purchase of an MT system is in many cases a costly affair and requires careful con-
 sideration. It is important to understand the organizational consequences and to be aware 
 of the system’s capacities. Unfortunately, it is not possible to draw up a comparison table 
 for MT systems on the basis of which MT buyers could choose their system. Although 
 system specifications can provide us with some useful information there are too many 
 aspects which influence the performance of MT that cannot be included in such a table. 
 Furthermore, MT will perform differently in different translation environments, 
 depending mainly on the character of the typical input texts. Without having the 
 necessary informa-tion of the kind of input texts the user has in mind, it is not possible to 
 make a reliable prediction about the cost effectiveness of an MT system. The 
 consequences are that if we want information about an MT system we have to evaluate it, 
 and that this evaluation has to be specifically for the user’s translational needs.
  
 The evaluation strategies discussed in this chapter are strategies that a buyer might want 
 to pursue when considering the purchase of an MT system. Although they will provide 
 the client with a certain amount of useful information, each method has some drawbacks, 
 which we have tried to point out in our discussion.

 A special issue of the Journal
  Machine Translation
  is dedicated to issues of evaluation of 
 MT (and other NLP) systems. The introduction to the issue, Arnold et al. (in press b), 
 gives an overview of the state of the issues involved, going into more detail about some 
 issues glossed over here. Several of the articles which appear in this issue report practical 
 experience of evaluation, and suggest techniques (for example, Albisser (in press); Flank 
 et al. (in press); Jordan (in press); Neal et al. (in press).)
  
 The problems of focusing evaluation on the MT engine itself (i.e. apart from surrounding 
 peripherals) are discussed in Krauwer (in press).
  
 As things stand, evaluating an MT system (or other NLP system) involves a great deal of 
 human activity, in checking output, for example. A method for automating part of the 
 evaluation process is described in Shiwen (in press).
  
 Some of the issues involved in construction of test suites are discussed in Arnold et al. (in 
 press a), and Nerbonne et al. (in press).
  
 In this chapter, we have generally taken the users’ perspective. However, evaluation is 
 also an essential for system developers (who have to be able to guage whether, and how 
 much, their efforts are improving a system). How evaluation technique can be applied so 
 as to aid developers discussed in Minnis (in press).
  
 One of the best examples of MT evaluation in terms of rigour was that which formed the 
 basis of the ALPAC report Pierce and Carroll (1966), which we mentioned in Chapter 1 
 (it is normal to be rude about the conclusions of the ALPAC report, but this should not 
 reflect on the evaluation on which the report was based: the evaluation itself was a model 
 of care and rigour — it is the interpretation of the results for the potential of MT which 
 was regrettable).
  
 See (Nagao, 1986, page 59) for more detailed scales and criteria for evaluating fidelity and 
 ease of understanding.
  
 As usual, Hutchins and Somers Hutchins and Somers (1992) contains a useful discussion 
 of evaluation issues (Chapter 9).

Glossary,"adjective phrase (AP)
  a complete construction
  headed
  by an adjective. APs typically 
 modify nouns and occur as complements to verbs such as
  be, seem, become
 . For 
 example: 
 The man
  guilty of this heinous crime
  was imprisoned
 .
  John seems rather 
 stupid
 .
  
 adjunct or modifier
  an optional or secondary element in a construction which can be 
 removed without affecting the structural status of the rest of the construction. For 
 example, 
 yesterday
  in:
  John kicked the ball yesterday
  (Compare
  John kicked the ball
  
 where
  the ball 
 is not an adjunct, because *
 John kicked yesterday
  is ungrammatical).
  
 affix
  morpheme placed at the beginning (prefix), middle (infix), or end (
 suffix
 ) of the
  
 root 
 or
  stem
  of a word, e.g.
  re
 legal
 ize
 .
  
 agreement
  the process whereby the form of one word requires a corresponding form of 
 another - for example, the plural form
  boys
  requires a plural form of the demonstrative 
 determiner
  these
 /*
 this
 :
  these boys
  vs *
 this boys
 .
  
 algorithm
  a prescribed set of well-defined rules or instructions for the solution of a prob-
 lem.
  
 analysis
  the phase in natural language processing systems (including MT systems) in 
 which a structure or representation is assigned to source language (input) sentences or the 
 representation itself or the name for the module of linguistic rules involved.
  
 anaphor
  a word or phrase which refers back to some previously expressed word or 
 phrase or meaning (typically, pronouns such as
  herself
 ,
  himself
 ,
  he
 ,
  she
 ).
  
 antecedent
  the word or phrase to which a later word or phrase (e.g. an
  anaphor
 ) refers.
