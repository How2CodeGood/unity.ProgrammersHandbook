Introduction,"And you may ask yourself, “Well, how did I get here?”
  
 —Talking Heads, “Once in a Lifetime”",NA
Why Are We Here?,"This report grew out of a series of “lunch-and-learns” on Linux 
 that I compiled for work. During that process, I ended up 
 writing an ebook
 , and then condensing it into a one-hour 
 presentation that focuses on the essentials needed for quick 
 problem-solving on a Linux system. I turned that presentation 
 into 
 an O’Reilly webcast
 , and this report provides more details 
 on those original 10 essentials.
  
 Even in formerly “pure Windows” shops, Linux use is growing. 
 Linux systems are everywhere! They may appear as 
 appliances 
 (machines) or, more likely, virtual machine (VM) images 
 dropped in by a vendor.
  
 Common examples of Linux systems that may appear in your 
 shop as VMs or in the cloud include the following:
  
 Web servers 
  
  
 Apache, Nginx, Node.js
  
 Database servers 
  
  
 MongoDB, PostgreSQL
  
 Mobile device management 
  
  
 Various MDM solutions, such as 
 MobileIron",NA
Who Is This For?,"The intended audience of this book is 
 not
  seasoned Linux 
 adminis‐trators, or anyone with a passing knowledge of the 
 Bash shell. Instead, it is for people who are working in small 
 Windows shops, where everyone has to wear various hats. It is 
 for Windows adminis‐trators, network admins, developers, and 
 the like who have no knowledge of Linux but may still have to 
 jump in during a problem.
  
 Imagine your boss rushing into your office and saying this:
  
 The main www site is down, and all the people who know about it 
 are out. It’s running on some sort of Linux, I think, and the 
 credentials and IP address are scrawled on this sticky note. Can 
 you get in, poke around, and see if you can figure it out?
  
 In this report, you’ll learn the basic steps to finding vital 
 informa‐tion that can help you quickly get the site back up. By 
 reading this guide before disaster strikes, you will be better able 
 to survive the preceding scenario.",NA
How to Prepare,"In small shops, sometimes things just 
 fall on you
  because no one 
 else is available. There is often no room for “It’s not my job” 
 when pro‐duction is down and the one person who knows 
 about it is back‐packing in Colorado. So you need to be prepared 
 as the use of Linux becomes more prevalent, turning “pure 
 Microsoft” shops more and more into hybrids. Linux is coming, 
 whether you like it or not. Be prepared.
  
 First, pay 
 close attention
  whenever you hear the word 
 appliance
  
 used in terms of a system. Perhaps it will be mentioned in 
 passing in a vendor presentation. Dig in and find out what the 
 appliance image is running.
  
 Second, note that 
 even Microsoft
  is supporting Linux, and 
 increasing that support daily. First, it started with making Linux 
 systems first-class citizens on Azure. Now Microsoft is 
 partnering with Docker and Ubuntu and others, and that 
 coordination looks like it is only going to grow.
  
 So now is the time to 
 start studying
 . This report is a quick-help 
 guide to prepare you for limited diagnostic and recovery tasks, 
 and to get you used to how Linux commands work. But you 
 should dig further.
  
 One place to turn next is 
 my ebook
 . It helps you take the next 
 steps of understanding how to change Linux systems in basic 
 ways. I’ve also included some useful references at the end of this 
 report. Past that, obviously, 
 O’Reilly has many good resources 
 for learning Linux
 . And the Internet is just sitting there, waiting 
 for you.",NA
Play with It!,"The best way to learn Linux is to stand up an environment 
 where you can explore without fear of the consequences if you 
 mess some‐thing up. One way is to create a Linux VM; even a 
 moderately provi‐sioned modern laptop will comfortably run a 
 Linux VM. You can also create one in the cloud, and many 
 vendors make that easy, including DigitalOcean, Linode, 
 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Microsoft Azure, and 
 Google Compute Engine. Many of these even offer a free level, 
 perfect for playing!",NA
Documentation and ,NA,NA
Instrumentation,"To protect yourself in case you are thrown into the scenario 
 outlined at the beginning of this report, you should make sure 
 the following are in place at your shop:
  
 The Linux systems are documented.
  
 This should include their purpose, as-built documentation 
 out‐lining the distro, virtual or physical hardware specs, 
 packages installed, and so on.
  
 These systems are being actively monitored.
  
 Are they tied in to Paessler Router Traffic Grapher (PRTG), 
 SIEM, and other monitoring and alerting systems? Make 
 sure you have access to those alerts and monitoring 
 dashboards, 
 as 
 they 
 can 
 be 
 a 
 great 
 source 
 of 
 troubleshooting information.
  
 You have access to the system credentials.
  
 Ideally, your department uses secure vault software to store 
 and share system credentials. Do you have access to the 
 appropriate credentials if needed? You should make sure 
 before the need arises.",NA
Conventions,"If a command, filename, or other computer code is shown inline 
 in a sentence, it appears in a fixed-width font:
  
 ls --recursive *.txt
  
 If a command and its output is shown on a terminal session, it 
 appears as shown in 
 Figure P-1
 .",NA
CHAPTER 0,NA,NA
Step 0: Don’t Panic,"The first, essential step is to stay calm. If you are dragged into 
 trying to diagnose a Linux system and it isn’t your area of 
 expertise, you can only do so much. We’re going to be careful to 
 keep from chang‐ing system configurations, and we’re going to 
 restart services or the system only as a last resort.
  
 So just try to relax, like Merv the dog (
 Figure 0-1
 ). No one 
 should expect miracles from you. And if you 
 do
  figure out the 
 problem, you’ll be a hero!

CHAPTER 1,NA,NA
Step 1: Getting In,"Before I get too far, let’s talk about how to connect to a Linux 
 system in the first place. If you have an actual physical machine, 
 you can use the console. In today’s day and age, this isn’t likely. 
 If you are running VMs, you can use the VM software’s console 
 mechanism.
  
 But most Linux systems run 
 OpenSSH
 , a Secure Shell service, 
 which creates an encrypted terminal connection via TCP/IP, 
 typically to port 22. So, obviously, if you are connecting to an 
 off-premise sys‐tem, the appropriate firewall holes have to be in 
 place on both sides. This allows you to connect from anywhere 
 you want to work.
  
 On Windows, you generally use 
 PuTTY
  to establish SSH sessions 
 with Linux systems. You typically need credentials as well, 
 either from that sticky note your boss found, or preferably via 
 your com‐pany’s secure credentials management system.
  
  
 You also could connect using public/private key 
 pairs, but that is beyond the scope of this 
 report.
  
 When you start PuTTY, it looks like 
 Figure 1-1
 .",NA
“sudo make me a sandwich”,"I’m going to take a brief intermission to discuss the 
 sudo
  
 command. It stands for 
 super-user do
 . If a user is in the 
 sudo
  
 user group, that user is allowed to execute privileged 
 commands. It is similar to doing a 
 RUNAS
  command in the 
 Windows Command Prompt to run a command under an 
 elevated account.
  
 Logging in remotely as 
 root
  (system administrator) is frowned 
 upon, and in fact often forbidden for security purposes. Hence, 
 you’ll need to use 
 sudo
  to run admin commands that you will 
 see later.",NA
CHAPTER 2,NA,NA
Step 2: Getting Around,"Now that you’re logged in, the first thing you’ll want to do is 
 inspect what is going on and how the system is configured. To 
 do that, you need to list files and directories, and move around 
 within the filesys‐tem. This chapter covers these basics.",NA
Where Am I?,"Some command prompts are set to show the current directory 
 path. Others are not, and it can be tough to remember where 
 you are in the filesystem. The 
 pwd
  (print working directory) 
 command shows you:
  
 bash-4.2$ pwd
  
 /etc/init.d
  
  
 Unlike in Windows, which is case-insensitive 
 (but case-aware), in Bash and in Linux in gen‐
 eral, 
 case matters
 . By convention, most Linux 
 commands are lowercase. If you try to type in 
 an uppercase 
 PWD
 , you will get a Command 
 Not Found error.",NA
Listing Files,"In Bash, the 
 ls
  (list) command is used to show directories and 
 files. It is similar to the 
 DIR
  command in Windows Command 
 Prompt.
  
 Figure 2-1
  shows a simple sample of an 
 ls
  command.
  
 7",NA
Changing Directories,"To change to a different directory, use the 
 cd
  (change directory) 
 command.
  
  
 Linux uses the 
 /
  character as the path 
 delimiter, unlike Windows, which uses 
 \
 . This 
 will
  trip you up the first few times, especially 
 because 
 \
  has a different meaning in Bash (it 
 is an escape char‐acter).
  
 Linux doesn’t use drive letters. Instead, all devices are mounted 
 in a single hierarchical namespace starting at the root (
 /
 ) 
 directory. You will see examples of this later in this report.

Be Lazy,"Most modern interactive shells like Bash and Windows 
 Command Prompt allow for tab expansion and command 
 history, at least for the current session of the shell. This is a 
 good thing in a crisis situa‐tion, because it saves you typing, and 
 thus, time.",NA
CHAPTER 3,NA,NA
Step 3: Peeking at Files,"Now that you know how to move around in the filesystem, it is 
 time to learn about how to inspect the content of files. In this 
 chapter, I show a few commands that allow you to look inside 
 files safely, without changing them.",NA
Cool cat,"The 
 cat
  (concatenate) command dumps a file to the console, as 
 shown in 
 Figure 3-1
 .
  
  
 Figure 3-1. cat command
  
 13",NA
less Is More,"The 
 less
  command paginates files or output, with each 
 “page”based on the size of the console window.
  
 In Bash, as in Windows Command Prompt, the output from one 
 command can be redirected, or piped, to another command by 
 using the 
 |
  character. In Linux, where each command “does one 
 thing, well,” it is common practice to combine multiple 
 commands, piping the output from one command to the next to 
 accomplish a series of tasks in sequence. For example, later in 
 this report you will see how to use the 
 ps
  command to produce 
 a list of running pro‐cesses and then pipe that output to the 
 grep
  
 command to search for a specific process by name. To 
 demonstrate, although 
 less
  can be passed a filename directly, 
 here’s how to pipe command output from 
 cat
  to 
 less
 :
  
 ~ $ cat /etc/passwd | less
  
 The output from 
 less
  clears the screen, and then shows the first 
 page, as you can see in 
 Figure 3-2
 .

 Chapter 3: Step 3: Peeking at Files",NA
tail Wind,"The 
 tail
  command shows the last lines in a file. It is useful when 
 you’re looking at large log files and want to see just the last 
 lines—for example, right after an error has occurred. By default, 
 tail
  will show the last 10 lines, but you can adjust the number of 
 lines dis‐played with the 
 -n
  parameter. For example, 
 Figure 3-3
  
 shows how to display just the last five lines.

CHAPTER 4,NA,NA
Step 4: Finding Files,"In the preceding chapter, you learned how to look inside files 
 without changing them. But how do you know which files to 
 look at? In this chapter, I cover searching for files, which can 
 help narrow the scope for your troubleshooting.",NA
find Files Fast,"The 
 find
  command is one of the most useful commands in Linux. 
 The command works like this:
  
 • Starting at location 
 x
  
 • Recursively find entries that 
 match
  condition(s)
  
 •
  Do something
  to each match
  
 As a simple example, let’s say you’re in the 
 /var/log
  directory, 
 and you want to find all files that end in 
 .log
 . Because there may 
 be a lot of them, you will pipe the output to 
 less
  so you can page 
 through it.
  
 Here is the command:
  
 /var/log# find . -name \*.log -print | less
  
 17",NA
"Location, Location, Location","The 
 locate
  command searches a list of all the filenames on the 
 sys‐tem. The filenames are gathered periodically by a service, so 
 it does not update in real time, but usually close enough. If you 
 know the name of a file you are looking for, perhaps the Apache 
 access.log
  file (which can change location depending on the 
 Linux distro), you can use the 
 locate
  command to quickly find it.

CHAPTER 5,NA,NA
Step 5: Search Me,"In the preceding chapter, you learned to search for files by their 
 attributes, such as name, last modified time, and the like. In this 
 chapter, I show how to search 
 inside
  a file, perhaps to find a 
 specific error message.",NA
Getting a grep,"The 
 grep
  command (whose name comes from 
 g
 lobally search a 
 r
 egular 
 e
 xpression and 
 p
 rint) searches within files. It uses 
 regular expressions (regex) to match patterns inside the files. It 
 can be used to search within binary files, but is most useful for 
 finding things inside text files. There are lots of uses for this 
 command in our crisis scenario, such as searching for certain 
 error messages within log files, or finding every mention of a 
 certain resource inside the source files for an entire website.
  
 There is an old joke by Jamie Zawinski:
  
 Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, “I know, I’ll 
 use regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.
  
 Some regular expressions are simple—for example, 
 *
 , which you 
 should recognize as a valid wildcard in Windows Command 
 Prompt. Others can be mind-blowingly complex. For example:
  
 ^\(*\d{3}\)*( |-)*\d{3}( |-)*\d{4}$
  
 This regular expression is an (incomplete) approach to 
 matching US phone numbers.

CHAPTER 6,NA,NA
Step 6: What’s Going On?,"You have now learned how to navigate around, look inside files, 
 and find files and search their contents. In this chapter and the 
 next, I show you how to determine real-time system state, with 
 an eye toward clues that may point to underlying problems.",NA
It’s All Part of the Process,"The 
 ps
  (process) command shows running processes, akin to the 
 Windows Task Manager, as you can see in 
 Figure 6-1
 .
  
  
 Figure 6-1. ps command
  
 By default, 
 ps
  shows only the processes for the current user. In 
 the preceding example, the active processes are the Bash shell 
 and the 
 ps 
 command itself.
  
 If you want to see all running processes, you add the 
 -A
  
 parameter. To make it pretty and show the hierarchical 
 relationship between parent and child processes, you add 
 -H
 :
  
 ps -AH | less
  
 Figure 6-2
  shows the output.
  
 29",NA
Who’s on top?,"The 
 top
  command (
 Figure 6-3
 ) shows processes sorted by 
 resource consumption. It updates every few seconds, similar to 
 Windows Task Manager.

 Chapter 6: Step 6: What’s Going On?",NA
The /proc Directory,"Linux doesn’t mount devices under drive letters as in Windows, 
 but instead uses a single hierarchical filesystem, with different 
 resources mounted under the root (
 /
 ) directory. In fact, because 
 Linux uses an“everything is a file” paradigm, 
 virtual
  filesystems 
 that aren’t backed by an actual device can be mounted in the 
 hierarchy as well.
  
 One of the best examples of this is the 
 /proc
  directory, a virtual 
 file‐system that presents real-time system statistics as files and 
 directo‐ries. This makes the information 
 way easier
  to access 
 than the rather opaque Windows WMI APIs. For example, you 
 can see information on the CPUs being used on the system, as 
 shown in 
 Figure 6-5
 .",NA
Networking,"The 
 ifconfig
  command shows information on the system’s 
 network interfaces (similar to the 
 IPCONFIG
  command in 
 Windows), as you can see in 
 Figure 6-9
 .

CHAPTER 7,NA,NA
Step 7: Filesystems,"You have just seen how to look at real-time system state in 
 terms of processes, memory, and networking. Now I show how 
 to check out the filesystems, with an eye toward disk utilization.",NA
Displaying Filesystems,"On any computer system, running out of disk space can cause 
 many problems. On Linux, two commands are helpful in 
 determining disk utilization.
  
 The 
 df
  (display filesystems) command shows the mounted files 
 sys‐tems along with statistics on space usage, as you can see in 
 Figure 7-1
 .
  
  
 Figure 7-1. df command
  
 The main device you’re interested in is the first one, which 
 shows 
 /dev/vda1
  mounted on 
 /
 . Note the columns showing disk 
 size, 
 Used
 , 
 Available
 , and 
 Use%
 .
  
 37",NA
Where Did All the Disk Space Go?,"Once you’ve seen that there may be a problem with disk space, 
 how do you find out 
 where
  it is being used? You can use the 
 du
  
 (disk uti‐lization) command for that. By default, it descends 
 through every directory and shows you disk usage for every 
 subdirectory under which it is invoked (think 
 DIR /S
  on 
 CMD.EXE
 ). That can generate a lot of output and can take a long 
 time to run.
  
 What we really want to do is start at the top and narrow our 
 search to a specific problem directory. Let’s just look at the top-
 level direc‐tories under 
 /
 . For that, I pass in the 
 -d 1
  (depth of 1) 
 parameter. To make the output easier to read, I also pass 
 -BM
  to 
 show blocks in megabytes. Finally, as you can see in 
 Figure 7-3
 , 
 I’m using 
 sudo
 , because otherwise I wouldn’t have permission to 
 descend into some system directories to calculate their disk 
 space.",NA
CHAPTER 8,NA,NA
Step 8: Transferring ,NA,NA
Files,"Perhaps you think you’ve found evidence of a system 
 compromise, or you fear log files will be altered if you end up 
 restarting services or the system itself. If you want to preserve 
 files on another system so that someone more knowledgeable 
 can look at them later, the commands in this chapter will come 
 in handy.
  
  
 Most commands in this report will not alter 
 sys‐tem state. However, the commands in 
 this chap‐ter and the next have the potential 
 to do so. In this chapter, the commands to 
 transfer files from the Linux system to 
 another system for later analysis can also 
 work in reverse—that is, trans‐fer files 
 to
  the 
 Linux box. So be careful!",NA
Secure Copying,"The 
 scp
  (secure copy) command can be used to copy files over 
 the SSH protocol (the same protocol that you’re running your 
 ssh
  ter‐minal session over). This command allows us to copy 
 files using an encrypted, compressed mechanism.
  
 If you are going to copy files from Linux “down” to your 
 Windows system, you need a program that will run on 
 Windows. The creator of PuTTY made 
 PSCP.EXE
  for precisely 
 that purpose: to implement 
 scp
  for Windows. You can download 
 it from the same place as 
 PuTTY
 .",NA
Copying to a Windows Share,"The 
 PSCP.EXE
  command can be used to 
 pull
  information from 
 Linux to your local Windows machine. If the Linux system is on 
 the same network as a Windows file share, you can use 
 smbclient
  to 
 push
  files to a CIFS/SMB file share. Both machines 
 must be on the same network for this to work; it will 
 not
  work 
 across the Internet.
  
 The 
 smbclient
  command uses similar subcommands as 
 ftp
 , so if 
 you have ever done FTP transfers from the Windows command 
 line, it should be familiar. One difference is that, instead of 
 specifying the subcommands one at a time after connecting, you 
 can pass a string",NA
CHAPTER 9,NA,NA
Step 9: Starting and ,NA,NA
Stopping,"If you are investigating a system that seems hung (perhaps the 
 pub‐lic website isn’t responding and your management wants 
 you to “do something”), the old tried-and-true method of 
 restarting services or the entire system itself is often your last 
 resort. Rebooting Windows always fixes problems, so you 
 already know one method for approaching Linux issues too! In 
 this chapter, I show you how to restart services and reboot the 
 system.
  
  
 Most commands in this report will not alter 
 sys‐tem state. However, this chapter covers 
 com‐mands that start, stop, and restart Linux 
 services and the entire system. Therefore, 
 you could pos‐sibly stop something, and 
 because 
 of 
 the 
 situa‐tion 
 you 
 are 
 investigating, not be able to restart it. So be 
 careful!",NA
Managing Services,"Linux services (a.k.a. 
 daemons
 , which is why so many Linux 
 services end in 
 d
 , such as 
 sshd
  and 
 httpd
 ) are similar to 
 Windows services. They are processes that run in the 
 background, typically initiated at system startup. Examples of 
 services include web services (Apache), database services 
 (MySQL), and so on.",NA
Killing a Process,"The 
 kill
  command sends 
 signals
  to processes. The default 
 behavior for a process is to stop when it receives a signal, 
 although signals can also be used to tell a service to reload its 
 configuration file, and so forth.
  
 Sometimes a service may hang to the point where it won’t 
 respond to the 
 service
  command. The next step is to try to kill it. 
 First, you need to find its process ID. In 
 Figure 9-9
 , we’re finding 
 the process ID for the 
 mysvc
  process.
  
  
 Figure 9-9. find mysvc process
  
 After you have the process ID (
 20330
  in this case), you can try to 
 kill it, as shown in 
 Figure 9-10
 .
  
  
 Figure 9-10. kill command
  
 Let’s look at 
 Figure 9-11
  to see if that worked.
  
  
 Figure 9-11. no more mysvc
  
 Yup—
 ps
  piped through 
 grep
  shows no active processes named 
 mysvc
  running.
  
 But sometimes even 
 kill
  doesn’t work. For one, programs can be 
 written to intercept most signals, enabling communication with 
 the background process from the command line. Or the process 
 may

 Chapter 9: Step 9: Starting and Stopping",NA
When All Else Fails,"Just as on Windows, sometimes a system restart is the ultimate 
 cure. The 
 reboot
  command does just what you’d expect. A 
 shutdown 
 command provides more options, such as waiting for 
 a number of seconds first, but you probably won’t need it. In any 
 case, both require 
 sudo

for Help,"This report is just a quick flyover of Linux commands and how 
 to use them to do quick troubleshooting. Even with the 
 commands covered in the report, I excluded many, many 
 options to keep it sim‐ple. But sometimes, even in the heat of 
 troubleshooting a system problem, you need a bit more help. 
 This chapter covers where you can go to get it.",NA
"Hey, man","The 
 man
  (manual page) command provides documentation on 
 com‐mands, system configuration files, and much more. This 
 command is good for when you can’t access the Internet, or 
 doing so isn’t con‐venient because you are on a machine console 
 or similar setup. 
 Figure 10-1
  shows the first page of output from 
 man reboot

Is That apropos?,"How do you know what you don’t know? Sometimes you might 
 not know (or remember) the name of a command. For example, 
 you may recall that this guide mentioned disk space, but can’t 
 remember the actual commands. Luckily, you can use the 
 apropos
  command to jog your memory, as shown in 
 Figure 10-2

The End,"Now you know what I know. Or at least what I keep loaded in 
 my head versus what I simply search for when I need to know it, 
 and you know how to do that searching, too. Hopefully, this 
 report will help you sometime when you most need it.
  
 Good luck, citizen!

Acknowledgments,"Thanks to my coworkers, who inspired and attended the lunch-
 and-learn sessions from which my ebook, webcast, and this 
 report grew—especially Aaron Vandegriff and Rob Harvey. I 
 received excellent advice and promotion from Professor Allen 
 Downey, for which I am grateful. I am thankful to my editor at 
 O’Reilly, Dawn Schanafelt, with her eye for detail and helpful 
 suggestions. Finally, I owe more than I can repay (as usual) to 
 my wife, Leslie, who deserves shared credit for putting up with 
 me during the nights and weekends I obsessed over this project.",NA
