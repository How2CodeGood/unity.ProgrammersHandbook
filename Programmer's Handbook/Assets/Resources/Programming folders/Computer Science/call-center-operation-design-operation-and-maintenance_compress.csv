Preface,"Over the last several years, corporate cultures around the world have changed to place increasing emphasis on 
 customer relations and to establish policies and procedures to enhance these relationships. Where there are 
 hundreds of thousands or even millions of customers, as is the case in the financial, communications, automotive, 
 travel, and insurance sectors, for example, the task of establishing a one-to-one relationship with each customer is 
 extremely challenging. Success in achieving the highest level of customer relationships requires a number of 
 components to be integrated into the changed corporate culture, including human resources and technology, and the 
 effective management of these resources.
  
 The need to establish and manage highly productive relationships with large numbers of customers has led to the 
 development of technologies specifically designed or adapted to assist organizations to manage, analyze, and 
 respond to the challenges posed by large customer databases and the need to communicate effectively and 
 productively with each customer. Many organizations have established a central department that uses these 
 technologies to manage customer relationships. These departments respond to inbound customer communication of 
 all types and are proactive in communicating with customers as well. This facility or department, generally referred to 
 as a 
 call center, customer interaction center,
  or 
 contact center,
  has gained considerable prominence over the last 
 several years. The total number of call centers of all sizes, internal and external, in North America alone is estimated 
 to be well over 100,000. Today, in many organizations, the call center is a central focus of all customer-oriented 
 activity-the eyes and ears of the organization.
  
 The call center, the term that will be used most often in this book, may be internal to a corporation or it may be an 
 external, outsourced function. Those organizations that have outsourced their call center operations, for lack of 
 financial or human resources, have been able to take advantage of the experience offered by large, often 
 multinational call center operations. These firms specialize in providing customer-related communications services 
 using sophisticated software and communications technology and skilled customer service representatives.
  
 The foundation for automation in call centers has been the integration of computers and telephony (CTI). CTI is not a 
 new concept-it was first implemented in the mid-1980s in large corporate call centers. Since that time, advances in 
 public telephone network technology and computing make CTI a powerful tool for businesses of any size, and 
 reduced hardware costs make the combined technologies affordable for smaller organizations.
  
 Effective management, use, and distribution of information have become increasingly important business 
 considerations in today's fast-paced business environment. In particular, the adoption of appropriate technologies to 
 accomplish these objectives can provide and sustain competitive advantage. Technology by itself cannot attain 
 business goals-how people use the technology makes the difference in effecting improvements in communications 
 and operational processes. CTI, the integration of computer and telephone technologies, has the capability to liberate 
 human and system resources and to maximize the benefits of both technologies for the user community.
  
 This book describes the evolution of the call center, analyzes the technologies that have contributed to its growth, and 
 describes the technology tools available. It also provides guidelines for the development and implementation of a call 
 center as well as the management of the facility, and it strongly emphasizes the human factors that can make a call 
 center a successful operation. This book also describes how call centers benefit businesses, how closely these 
 facilities are related to the corporation's overall CRM strategy, and how technology and changing business trends are 
 reshaping the workplace. These trends have resulted in more horizontal organizations, high-performance workgroups, 
 empowered employees, and, in general, the ability of staff members to do more with less.
  
 Many sources have been consulted and used in preparing this book, and I am indebted to those authors whose 
 works have contributed to the text; these are referenced in 
 Appendix C
 . I am particularly indebted to Janet 
 Sutherland, senior consultant with Bell Canada Contact 
  
 Centre Solutions, for contributions to

 manuscript; and for providing 
  
 valuable knowledge and insight on call center operations in general.

Chapter 1: ,NA,NA
Introduction to Call Centers,"During the past decade in particular, the influence of technology on the relationships between organizations in both 
 the public and private sectors has increased dramatically. Today, companies depend heavily on technology of various 
 types to conduct their businesses and to deal with their customers, whether through a business-to-business (B2B) or 
 a company-customer relationship. The call center industry especially is changing the face of business throughout the 
 world and is having a significant impact on economies and the way companies do business.",NA
1.1 Overview,"Call centers require the integration of several different technologies to maximize the use of information and to 
 streamline the activities of call center operators. Advances in technology and the adaptation and integration of 
 synergistic technologies have resulted in the development of numerous feature that have enhanced the growth of call 
 centers throughout the world.
  
 The computer and the telephone are two of the major and most familiar tools of technology that have converged to 
 make call centers more efficient and productive. When used properly along with software technology that assists 
 operators to assimilate and analyze customer data to respond knowledgeably to customer inquiries, the benefits to 
 both the customer and the organization are substantial, as this book will demonstrate.",NA
The impact of CTI,"Over the past few years, there has been much discussion of the pros and cons of a new set of technologies 
 involving the integration of the computer and the telephone, referred to as 
 CTI
  (for computer telephony integration, 
 frequently shortened to 
 computer telephony
 ). Computer telephony was developed specifically to integrate these two 
 technologies to enable more effective and productive communication between companies and their customers. CTI 
 is best viewed as a loose but complicated amalgamation of interlocking technologies-not one piece of hardware or 
 software, but a method of combining the two streams of information-voice and data-through open, standards-based 
 systems.
  
 As the combined technologies matured, CTI found many applications in the business world; however, one of its most 
 significant contributions is to call center operation. When well implemented, it can dramatically improve the way a 
 company interacts with its customers, the fundamental purpose for implementing a call center. Computer telephony 
 overcomes the traditional limitations of either of the component technologies and brings them together in a way that 
 improves them both, by bringing more information to both parties in a communication environment.",NA
Software tools,"Software is a driving force behind call center development. Although call centers have traditionally been telecom 
 entities, the growth and maturation of CTI have led to computing-based centers and applications. Software is one 
 of the best and most widely used tools for translating business parameters into technological terms. Call center 
 software can fulfill a number of functions, including the following key applications:
  
 ●     
 Retrieving customer information
  
 ●     
 Managing queues
  
 ●     
 Providing sales scripts and product information
  
 ●     
 Acting as an interconnection to back-office applications
  
 In the past, call center managers have had to juggle business objectives with flexibility, because frequent changes in 
 marketing campaigns affect call center operation. A call center can't stand still-it is important to build the change 
 dynamic into the system at the beginning. Today, software vendors are combining functional capabilities in single 
 products, some of which are ready-made products and others which are sets of tools for greater customization. This 
 evolution in product design virtually eliminates the need for organizations to develop their own systems from scratch. 
 The range of choice in specialized software means that writing an entire call center system in a standard software 
 environment is no longer required.",NA
Inside the call center,"The advanced call center operation of the 21st century consists of many elements and is not simply a collection of 
 phones, computers, and operators. The first call centers were often large rooms with a PBX (private branch 
 exchange) phone switch and desks of service representatives taking calls over the phone. Customers in many cases 
 endured long response times and had to repeat information such as account numbers or descriptions of their 
 problems. In these earlier call centers, little, if any, customer information was available to customer service 
 representatives (CSRs). This kind of service regularly resulted in frustrated customers and customer representatives. 
 There may be vestiges of these days in some call center operations that have not kept up with changing technology, 
 staff training processes, and corporate culture changes in managing customer relationships, but these antiquated 
 facilities will not last long.
  
 In today's Internet-paced world, with e-commerce flourishing and many more opportunities for customer contact with 
 companies, customers will not tolerate a long, tedious response process, and it is no longer sufficient for customer 
 representatives to depend solely on reference books when troubleshooting or assisting customers. They need to 
 have customer information available immediately and presented on their computer screens, as well as the capability 
 to modify this information during a communication session with a customer. CSRs become the focus of customer 
 interaction with a company in a well-planned, well-managed call center operation.",NA
Call center/contact center,"Call centers provide a single contact for customers who may try to reach a company via multiple channels: e-mail, 
 Web chat, fax, phone, or VoIP (voice over Internet protocol). Call centers, often called 
 contact centers
  to reflect the 
 multiple points of access, provide staff with consistent information throughout an integrated system. (In this book, the 
 term 
 call center
  is used interchangeably with 
 contact center
 ). These centers capture data from across the enterprise 
 and consolidate customer-related information into a central database. This integration improves the customer's 
 interaction and satisfaction and enhances the efficiency of the business operation.
  
 Businesses have several issues to consider in their daily relationships with customers:
  
 ●     
 Keeping customers satisfied before and after sales
  
 ●     
 Managing customer data scattered all over the enterprise
  
 ●     
 Planning and budgeting resources to invest in customer retention
  
 Call centers are an essential part of any business that deals frequently with customer queries. Integrated call 
 centers decrease customer waiting time, improve customer access, and improve call routing. The end result is that 
 companies benefit from satisfied customers who come back for more business. In spite of the high costs of a call 
 center, most organizations, large or small, that value customer service and strong customer relationships need to 
 have one.",NA
1.2 Analyzing call center requirements,"There are many aspects to designing and developing a call center operation, including selecting the location, 
 telephone equipment, networking equipment, and software. This combination of technologies and the 
 complexity of integrating all elements effectively and economically present a challenge to the call center 
 development team.
  
 Building a call center internally may be feasible only for very large enterprises—smaller companies should consider 
 outsourcing their call centers to organizations that specialize in providing these services and already have the latest 
 technologies installed and operating, with trained staff. These organizations can often provide excellent customer-
 oriented services, relieving smaller organizations of the financial, managerial, and human resources issues involved 
 in an internal, corporate call center. Calculating the overall budget for the project will determine whether to build and 
 manage a call center internally or to outsource some or all of the operations to keep costs down and focus on 
 customer retention. Building a call center can run to several million dollars in capital equipment alone, not to mention 
 the cost of hiring staff and managing the day-to-day operations.
  
 With the Internet and potentially rapid response opportunities, new ways for customers to reach companies—e-mail, 
 Web chat, and voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)—have been added to the traditional forms of communication. To 
 prepare for these multiple communications media and to efficiently serve customers, companies need to capture 
 information from across the enterprise and consolidate customer-related data into a central database. In most 
 cases, customer data resides in many systems, such as order history, fulfillment, shipping, and billing. The number 
 of sources of data can reduce the ability of CSRs to handle requests and can also contribute to errors and 
 duplication. For corporations to handle these multiple customer contact channels effectively, integrating the varied 
 systems is essential. Its call center facility requires carefully selected technology tools.
  
 A complete analysis of the technology and human relations components of a call center reveals a number of planning 
 and selection challenges for the project team charged with development, management, and maintenance of the call 
 center operation. It also highlights the major issues to be addressed for the start-up and on-going management of the 
 center. This analysis will involve the following major activities:
  
 ●     
 Location and size
  
 ●     
 Technologies
  
 ●     
 Staffing and training
  
 ●     
 Communication channels
  
 ●     
 Monitoring and measuring performance
  
 ●     
 Call management and handling
  
 ●     
 Integrated call centers",NA
Location and size,"A first step in implementing a call center is to decide on the location of the facility. Whether it is a small department in 
 a local facility or a large, enterprisewide center, this step is important to corporate growth and the bottom line, so it 
 must be planned carefully. The high cost of real estate in populous areas is driving many call center operations to 
 locate in rural areas. This is especially true throughout North America, where call centers are concentrated in several 
 regions of the United States, as well as in Canada. With the communication and computer technology available 
 today, it is very easy to locate call centers in any area where high-speed, high-quality communication resources are 
 available, and many organizations have made this choice.
  
 The size of the call center refers not only to square footage but also to the number of CSRs required, telephony and 
 LAN equipment, client desktops, and other switching and computer hardware. Because call centers usually grow in 
 size, it is a sound planning practice to choose a site with room for expansion.",NA
Technologies,NA,NA
Staffing and training,"Hiring skilled staff is more important than ever in a call center operation, where the impact of effective, responsive 
 customer communication can be critical to a company's customer relationship management (CRM) strategy. 
 Modern call centers are much more complex than earlier facilities and require well-trained personnel. Customers 
 are more demanding; they expect immediate response and intelligent help.
  
 It is important to train CSRs, often for specific roles, and to give them call center responsibilities that reflect their 
 areas of expertise. For instance, some are better on the phone and others are better at handling e-mail. To 
 streamline the distribution of contacts and the effective use of trained staff, choose tools with workflow process 
 support and skills-based routing. The latter feature enables the system to take a call regarding a specific product or 
 application and then automatically route it to a representative with the appropriate skills to handle the request.
  
 Once CSRs have been hired and properly trained, retaining them is just as important as retaining customers. 
 Customer service 
  
 representatives need to be kept up to speed on support methods, products, and processes. Keep knowledge bases 
 up-to-date so that agents can satisfy customers in the best manner. Advanced training, recognition, and competitive 
 salaries are essential in retaining an effective, productive, call center workforce.",NA
Communication channels,"The variety of different customer channels available for contacting a call center means that incoming calls need to 
 be answered in a timely manner. Response processes and call management features that enable the appropriate 
 agent to assist the caller require a definition of workflow processes and SLAs (service-level agreements) with 
 customers. Call centers that have automated workflow and skills-based routing can effectively route the incoming 
 calls and ensure that the calls are being responded to appropriately by trained CSRs. Integrating with the Internet is 
 critical, because this capability provides more avenues for assisting customers with chat, self-help, and live agents.",NA
Monitoring and measuring performance,"Monitoring tools and reporting features are essential for measuring response times and the number of calls received; 
 these data help ensure that corporate goals are being met and can also be used to increase productivity. The 
 process of keeping a call center running smoothly is an ongoing task that needs to be reviewed and revised from time 
 to time to address problem areas and to help improve customer relations.",NA
Call management and handling: websites,NA,NA
Integrated call centers,"Call centers are changing as a result of the influence of the Internet and its integration into the call center. Integrated 
 call centers decrease customer waiting time, offer alternate access to an organization, improve customer access, and 
 improve call routing. Numerous studies and surveys have demonstrated that companies benefit from satisfied 
 customers, who come back for more business. In spite of the high costs of a call center, most organizations with 
 either a large number of customers or a frequent requirement to communicate with even a small number of 
 customers need this facility to successfully compete in the 21st-century business environment.",NA
1.3 Vendor solutions,"A number of vendors have proven success in assisting organizations to develop, implement, and integrate call 
 centers into their corporate customer management structures. 
 Appendix A
  provides a selected list of these vendors 
 with contact and product or service information. The 
  
 technology tools offered by these vendors range in price from very expensive licensed solutions, in the range of 
 $200,000 to $300,000, to relatively inexpensive hosted models, averaging $600 to $1,000 per call center position 
 (seat).",NA
Selection,"Among these tools, it is important to select those that fit the organization's needs and integrate well with existing 
 telephony equipment and current applications. The tools should be compatible with PBX equipment and dispersed 
 data sources from data warehouses, shipping, and customer accounts. Also, the tools selected need to have the 
 capability to handle multiple customer-access channels, such as telephone, Web self-help, e-mail, fax, and Internet 
 chat.",NA
Integration,"Integrating all these components is time-consuming and expensive; however, it is necessary to the development of 
 an effective call center that is fully responsive to customer interactions. The list of systems and applications that 
 need to be integrated might include the following items:
  
 ●     
 Data warehousing systems
  
 ●     
 Legacy systems
  
 ●     
 Disparate relational databases
  
 ●     
 Internet technologies
  
 It is important to select vendor tools that are capable of integrating telephony equipment and software components 
 with all of these systems and applications.",NA
1.4 A 10-point call center development process,"The following 10 guidelines provide a logical, step-by-step process for developing and managing a call center 
 operation.",NA
Select a location for the call center where there is an educated workforce ,"Determine the size of the facility and the number of service representatives. Real estate and labor are two key cost 
 factors in any call center operation.",NA
Select the underlying technology components ,"These will include: PBX, voice mail, automated call distribution, computer telephony integration, and network 
 equipment, such as routers, servers, and desktop PCs.",NA
Decide which channels to support in the call center ,"Channels will include e-mail, chat, phone, Web forms, text chat, 
 VoIP.",NA
Select software solutions that meet requirements and will integrate with existing systems ,"Typically, these systems will be those that contain customer information-data warehousing systems, accounting 
 systems, and contact information.",NA
Integrate systems when feasible ,"Call centers must be able to handle multiple customer channels. Integrated systems help customer representatives 
 answer questions more quickly by having more customer information available to them. Integrating with the Internet 
 is critical, as it provides more avenues for assisting customers with chat, self-help, and live agents.",NA
Determine SLAs and business processes ,"Implement best practices-workflow and e-mail routing-for skills-based routing capability. Establish hours of 
 operation and standard procedures for handling calls.",NA
Hire and retain staff ,"Establish a hiring and training budget. Hire skilled individuals and provide training, retraining, motivation, and 
 rewards. Identify required skills and set appropriate goals to keep representatives trained.",NA
Finalize the budget ,"Make presentations to management regarding budgets and benefits. Factor in all costs, including training, 
 hiring, hardware costs, deployment, and integration.",NA
Establish measurement and performance processes ,"Software for monitoring service levels and performance is the key to measuring call center results. Survey 
 customers to ensure satisfaction. Evaluate response times. Utilize reporting tools and continue to improve service.",NA
Establish on-going policies for training and updating CSRs ,"The CSR is the lifeblood of the call center and it is important that these employees be kept up-to-date on the tools 
 used in the center and that their job functions be kept interesting and challenging.

Call Center Technology,NA,NA
Overview,"Chapter 1
  described the essential components of a call center and the importance of technology, particularly the 
 integration of several 
  
 technologies, in the implementation and operation of the call center and in providing the range of services 
 required to manage customer communications effectively. This chapter describes the evolution of call center 
 technologies and provides a detailed analysis of these technologies and how they function as well as how they 
 can be applied to meet call center requirements.
  
 Advances and changes in technology have made many new features available to call center operations, providing 
 increased efficiency and better opportunities for serving customers and empowering CSRs with the capability of 
 better managing customer interactions. Most call centers use several systems and applications with specialized 
 functions. In parallel with these advances in technologies that are internal to the call center, more ""intelligent"" network 
 services offered by carriers make possible the routing of calls based on a wide range of criteria—area code or prefix, 
 dialed number identification service (DNIS), time of day, day of week, and other parameters that are under the control 
 of call center management. Call allocation facilities are also available that can program the network to send defined 
 percentages of calls to selected sites.
  
 Other significant changes that have occurred in the call center because of the availability of enabling technologies 
 include the following:
  
 ●     
 Accessing of applications using icon-based GUI windows, allowing for simultaneous task execution
  
 ●     
 Scanning and retrieval of on-screen documents, a process that increases the speed of document handling
  
 ●     
 Prerecorded CSR introductory greetings, with digital clarity
  
 ●     
 Enhanced fax-handling capabilities, including presorting and generating faxes automatically from the CSR 
 terminal during talk time, automated fax-back, and fax on demand
  
 ●     
 Capability to monitor and blend calls, switching CSRs automatically from inbound to outbound calls when traffic 
 permits
  
 ●     
 Call selection techniques using a PC control window that enables CSRs to point to a call to answer from a list of 
 calls in a queue
  
 The technologies that are required to support an effective, high-productivity call center operation can be classified 
 under the following major headings:
  
 ●     
 Computer telephony integration (CTI)
  
 ●     
 Call distribution technology (ACD)
  
 ●     
 Database software.
  
 As pointed out in 
 Chapter 1
 , effective management, use, and distribution of information are important elements in 
 today's fast-paced 
  
 business environment. Technologies play an important role in the accomplishment of these objectives and provide 
 and sustain competitive advantage. Technology by itself cannot attain business goals, it is how people use the 
 technology that will ultimately lead to improvements in communications and operational processes. CTI, the 
 integration of computer and telephone technologies, is one of the applications of technology that has the capability of 
 maximizing the benefits of both technologies for the user community. CTI is an approach to merging two fundamental 
 modern-day technologies, bringing together the disparate and advanced technologies of computing and telephony in 
 a manner that focuses on providing user organizations with choice and flexibility in the implementation of call center 
 operations.",NA
2.1 Computer telephony integration (CTI),"The significance of the integration of the computer and the telephone (CTI), is reflected in the growth of the 
 communications market, around which CTI has been developed. Telephone call volumes are growing exponentially: 
 In 1980, Americans made about 200 million international phone calls, and by 1998, that number had risen to 4.5 
 billion. The global fiberoptic networking market is expected to reach $52 billion in 2003, $25 billion higher than in 
 1999. The rapid growth of networked systems, and the increasing demand for more bandwidth have enhanced the 
 importance of CTI as well, as illustrated by the sophistication of enterprise systems such as call centers. The impact 
 of open systems, new technologies such as the Internet, VoIP, and wireless computing are altering fundamental 
 business models. (see 
 Figure 2.1
 )
  
  
 Figure 2.1: 
 CTI-An open architecture.",NA
The evolution of CTI,"One of the overall design objectives of CTI was to enable better contact between companies and their customers 
 through the seamless and intelligent integration of both technologies. It has been defined as a ""loose but complicated 
 amalgamation of interlocking technologies,"" a way of combining the two streams of information-voice and data-
 through open, standards-based systems. It has uses in many areas of today's technology-based business, but 
 certainly one of its most significant applications is in the call center. In this facility, it provides opportunities to improve 
 the way a company interacts with its customers, the key focus of any call center operation.",NA
The computer environment,"The distributed computing architectures that have become commonplace in today's business world began with the 
 mainframe, a massive structure of processing and data storage elements. The mainframe environment provided 
 centralized ""host"" facilities to run applications-users outside of the computing department used ""dumb"" terminals 
 and cumbersome commands to access applications and request actions.",NA
Mainframe computing,"Mainframe computing platforms are still an integral element of many IS environments and are often referred to as 
 legacy systems
  in reference to the legacies of information they still retain, the considerable investment they 
 represent, and the role they play in today's computing architecture. That role is usually focused on the handling of 
 record-intensive functions such as employee or customer financial databases (health care records, automobile 
 licensing, inventory, etc.). (see 
 Figure 2.2
 )
  
  
 Figure 2.2: 
 Mainframe architecture. 
  
 Rapid advances in processing technology and the demanding desktop/ workgroup requirements of the marketplace 
 stimulated the evolution of the minicomputer in the late 1970s and personal computing-the ubiquitous PC-in the early 
 1980s. This widespread availability of relatively inexpensive computing power allowed new architectures to evolve. 
 (see 
 Figure 2.3
 ) The architecture of choice in today's computing 
  
 environment is 
 client/server
  computing. In this model, an intelligent terminal (PC) is connected to various 
 applications and services by a local area network (LAN), and in large enterprises users are usually connected to 
 remote locations via a wide area network (WAN). These networks of computing power are commonplace in the 
 business world of the 21st century.",NA
Client/Server computing,"Today's typical office environment includes a variety of input and output devices-PCs, scanners, printers, and so on-
 all connected by a LAN. The client/server model extends ""sharing"" to files, databases, and more importantly 
 additional applications by putting the shared elements into a shared PC (the server). By doing so, each desktop PC 
 (the client) accesses the server to extract or input information. When users update a record, the server database is 
 updated, so that everyone in the workgroup is sharing up-to-date information. Client/server applications allow users to 
 configure their screens to meet specific needs and preferences, yet have the benefits of shared information. (see 
 Figure 2.4
 )",NA
The communications environment,"Most call center applications require a dedicated piece of hardware for pure telephony switching; however, all the 
 add-on functions of value-the call center specific applications-can reside on a ""telephone server"" connected to the 
 phone switch. One product that is commonly used in this application is a Windows NT box.
  
 In addition to interoperability standards, there are other links in any data/voice application. ""Voice,"" for example, could 
 refer to different kinds of calls-traditional phone calls are one example, recorded calls in the form of messages, fax 
 traffic, and even the digits callers enter when they pass through a voice response system are other examples of voice 
 traffic. Data traffic originates with the host information in databases and includes the subset of host data that moves 
 to the desktop and back, as well as MIS data that passes through the corporate LAN, through intranets, over the 
 Internet (including company Web traffic), and e-mails.
  
 Prior to the advances in network technology, it was relatively easy to isolate voice-form data streams; however, now 
 a corporation's system might also be dealing with varying combinations of new technologies that include elements 
 of both voice and data: voice over the Internet (VoIP), fax over the Internet, speech recognition, browser-based 
 transaction processing, and ""call me"" buttons that appear on Web pages.",NA
Standards for CTI,NA,NA
Call control,"Some of the new applications focused on 
 call control
 -the movement and tracking of calls in a phone network. Many 
 others were applications that took advantage of the growing LAN/phone system connections to bring data to the 
 desktop at the same time as the phone call arrived. Wherever voice and data networks come together, standards 
 are required to ensure that the integration goes smoothly.
  
 The Internet has required the implementation of additional standards. Building applications combining call control and 
 data manipulation became a lot easier with the adoption of Java and TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/Internet 
 protocol), as standards for data communication. The development of standards to manage these combinations of 
 ""information traffic"" makes it easier to move data and voice together. It has become irrelevant what form the 
 information takes. What is more important is how that information is used and who has access to it.
  
 CTI has become more precisely defined as ""
 any technology that combines some form of real-time, person-to-person 
 company communication with a background of data that adds value to that communication
 ."" CTI was first 
 implemented in the mid-1980s in large corporate call centers. Since then, advances in public telephone network 
 technology and computing have made CTI a powerful tool for businesses of any size. Along with technological 
 advances have come reductions in the cost of implementation, making CTI available and affordable to a much 
 broader range of organizations.
  
 Computer telephony can trace part of its origins to the fact that adding to a typical office PBX required purchasing 
 the add-on to the equipment from the original vendor through a third-party company that wrote to the PBX vendor 
 proprietary specification. For most of the 1990s, this was the method use to install CTI systems-customization, with 
 detailed on-site upgrading and continual fixing of both major and minor glitches to keep the system working. Current 
 CTI systems have benefited from these early experiences and are now much easier to implement. They can now 
 meet the requirements of both large and small companies, in relatively standard versions that require little, if any, 
 customization.
  
 The adaptation of CTI was further hindered in the early days of the technology by the fact that software companies 
 were reluctant to develop add-ons because the cost of developing them for multiple switch vendors was prohibitively 
 high. However, the more perceptive members of both the PBX and computer industries realized that their 
 technologies were more alike than different. Switches were really high-performance communications servers, and if 
 the specifications could be opened up and standards developed, both sides would benefit from the many application 
 requirements that would be met by the combined technologies.",NA
Switch-to-host integration,"As noted previously in this chapter, advances in technology have brought sophisticated capabilities within the 
 price range of even the smallest call centers, and 
 switch-to-host integration
  has contributed most significantly to 
 this change. Switch-to-host integration represents a total transformation of the capabilities of a call center. Small 
 companies can now avail themselves of technology that takes advantage of a range of network-provided 
 services to provide more options with each customer communication.",NA
Voice response,"Voice response systems deliver recorded information to incoming calls and are an important element in any call 
 center operation. Interactive voice response, IVR, is two-way: It responds with information when a caller enters digits 
 on the touch-tone phone. The response information is generated from a database, and this application is one of the 
 key functions of CTI. In the typical voice response application, this feature is available on a 24/7 basis, and customers 
 can make a variety of inquiries regarding their accounts or order status. The IVR engine queries a database in the 
 background and reads the information to the caller. This is a dynamic function and represents a much better form of 
 customer communication than a canned, prerecorded response. When converted to an Internet-based operation, the",NA
CTI applications ,"Some of the specific applications for CTI in inbound call centers include
  
  
 ●     
 Synchronized voice and data delivery
  
  
 ●     
 Simultaneous voice and data transfer
  
  
 ●     
 Voice and data conferencing

 Desktop-based productivity tools 
  
 Computer telephony surpasses the traditional limitations of both component technologies (phones and computers) 
 and combines their best features to bring more information to the person on the phone and to make data more 
 accessible and more useful to CSRs. Computer telephony adds computer intelligence to a phone call. Everything 
 from simple screen presentations to predictive dialing is a CTI application. The capability of integrating the computer 
 and telecom system brings customer phone calls along with data files right to the CSR's desktop as the call comes in. 
 This translates to massive savings in 800 line charges and agent labor. In practice, implementing CTI has been a 
 tricky proposition. In its early configurations, it was usually custom-made for a particular application. Companies used 
 a systems integrator to pull together the necessary links, proprietary interfaces, and special connections to 
 applications.",NA
Integration of CTI ,"There are several issues related to the integration of CTI with other corporate systems. These issues 
 include the following:
  
 ●     
 Linkages to multiple disparate data sources
  
  
 ●     
 Limitations imposed by vendor-specific protocols
  
  
 ●     
 Upgrades to attached systems that may cause changes in other systems or disable some 
 functions
  
  
 ●     
 Combining standard and custom applications",NA
The benefits of CTI ,"CTI in the call center brings many benefits as well as changes to businesses, by changing business trends, reshaping",NA
Call center applications,"Applications run on top of operating systems and are designed to perform specific functions (e.g., create 
 spreadsheets, perform word processing functions, manage e-mail, provide contact management data, etc.). In 
 single-tasking environments, such as DOS and Windows, only one program runs at a time; other programs are 
 suspended until the user restarts them. In a multitasking environment-Windows, UNIX, or OS/2-multiple programs 
 can be running with the user switching (or linking) between programs as required. One of the key elements of 
 modern application development and design is the concept of an 
 application programming interface
  (API). The API 
 provides the defined interface between various devices or software layers in the computing model so that software 
 developers can focus on the application. A printer API is a good example of this type of software. APIs are relevant 
 to both desktop PC applications as well as server applications and are also an important element in CTI.",NA
CTI and call center productivity,"CTI is an information delivery tool that will assist CSRs to communicate intelligently and knowledgeably with 
 customers by providing them with information they need to address customer needs. In addition to the information-
 handling features offered by CTI, this combined technology also provides the capability to perform 
 quality control 
 measurements
  in a call center, enabling calls to be monitored, recorded, and archived so that the CSR and the 
 supervisor can review them and assess performance. The analysis process is made much more productive when it 
 is augmented by the data that passes through the agent's screen during the call. A company record of every 
 transaction can be kept indefinitely, providing an audit trail and a training aid.
  
 Call center productivity improvements resulting from CTI include the following:",NA
2.2 Network structures and CTI servers,"A network structure is made up of several components—client computers and servers consisting of transport 
 mechanisms—forming a physical interface and network architecture. Some examples of network architectures are 
 Ethernet, 10BASE-T, Token Ring, and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode). A communications protocol (TCP/IP or 
 SPX/IPX (sequenced packeteXchange/internetwork 
  
 packeteXchange)) is also required to link the elements of a network. Each PC on the network has a LAN card to 
 provide an interface to the network.
  
 The server is a device that empowers the network and the attached users. There are several types of servers in LAN 
 environments: file and print servers, departmental database servers, and legacy hosts acting as database servers. 
 CTI introduces a new class of servers to the LAN infrastructure—
 telephony servers
 . (see 
 Figure 2.5
 ) Server platforms 
 generally consist of the same basic hardware as the desktop PC but 
  
 have some differences in operating characteristics. Generally, they are faster, more powerful, and have much more 
 memory and disk space. They come in a variety of configurations and levels of robustness, depending on their 
 intended use and the importance of maintaining data integrity or network connections. 
 Telecom servers
  are a special 
 class of telephony servers that deliver high bandwidth and require higher-capacity buses. These devices are 
 described in more detail later in this chapter. (see 
 Figure 2.6
 )

 LAN server architecture.",NA
Communications in the call center,"There are a number of different telephone operating models, all of which may have a role in call center 
 operations. The communications environment chosen for a call center will be related to the call volumes 
 anticipated, number of seats in the center, and the geographical extent and coverage of the call center. Two of 
 the most popular communication models are described in this section:
  
 ●     
 Public network
  
 ●     
 Customer premise",NA
Public network model,"The most important telephony elements related to CTI are services provided by public telephone networks and the 
 capabilities of 
 call processing
  and 
 call control
 . The world's public telephone networks are complex, with millions of 
 endpoints hard-wired and connected through thousands of central connecting points called central offices (COs). 
 The public network has evolved over the years from its POTS (plain old telephone service) analog beginnings to 
 the broad range of advanced, sophisticated services provided by today's digital technology. (see 
 Figure 2.7
 )",NA
Customer premise model,"As the telephone became a must-have business and management tool, the logistics and costs associated with 
 adding a new telephone line for every new employee or every new phone became overwhelming. 
 Customer 
 premise equipment
  (
 CPE
 ) was developed to overcome these problems; it falls into two categories:
  
 ●     
 Access points to network services",NA
Telecom switching systems,"The following elements are found in all telecom switching systems:
  
 ●     
 Operating system software
  that controls the hardware
  
 ●     
 Call processing software
  that makes connections, provides features, and delivers services
  
 ●     
 Line side
  interfaces connecting the switch to the end-user telephone set
  
 ●     
 Trunk side
  interfaces connecting the customer's switch to the network
  
 ●     
 A switching fabric
  linking the various interfaces",NA
Operating system software,"In the telecommunications environment as in the world of computing, hardware is controlled by operating system 
 software. The telecom environment has special needs for multiuser, real-time, fault-tolerant operating systems. The 
 complexities of the features available have resulted in switch products that use proprietary operating systems, a 
 parallel to the proprietary legacy systems of the computing environment.",NA
Call processing applications,"The heart of a modern switching system is a set of software applications known collectively as 
 call processing.
  This 
 software provides all the functionality seen by the user—from the basic call setup to delivering caller ID. This software 
 also provides user features (such as call forwarding), enhanced network services (such as least-cost routing), and 
 specialized call handling for call centers. Call processing is the basis for powerful CTI applications that can make a 
 call center highly effective and productive.",NA
Interfacing hardware,"Modern telecom systems operate by converting analog voice signals into a digital format known as 
 pulse code 
 modulation
  (PCM). The digital format is far superior for clear transmission, storage, compression, and even 
 encryption. This process is accomplished by a silicon chip, a CODEC (for code and decode) designed into the line 
 interface. The CODEC samples the voice signal 8000 times per second and transforms it into the digital signal, 
 ready for transmission. At the other end, another CODEC chip transforms the digital signal into a recognizable voice 
 signal.
  
 The switching device performs the function of connecting the digital signal from the line interface to the destination, 
 which might be another line interface (
 intercom call
 ), a trunk interface (
 network call
 ), or a common resource (such as 
 a 
 conference bridge
 ). Once established, the connection stays up for the duration of the call. The trunk interface is a 
 shared pipe into the public network. There are various types of trunk interfaces, defined by their bandwidth",NA
2.3 Basic CTI services,"The starting point for all CTI development is a set of basic services, which include 
 call control, call monitoring,
  and 
 feature activation
 . There are two recognized industry standards (CSTA (computer supported telecommunication 
 applications) and SCAI (switch to computer applications interface)) for performing these functions as well as several 
 dozen proprietary designs.",NA
Call control,"Switching software is the core technology enabling CTI to provide an outside application with some form of control 
 over switch functions. The outside application is offered or can access a set of commands; for example, make call, 
 answer call, and transfer call. When a command is issued, the switch tries to complete its assigned task and reports 
 back to the application with a result. That result might mean complete success (the call went through), progress has 
 been made (the other end is now ringing), or failure (the dialed number is busy or goes unanswered). This 
 information has to be provided on a real time basis as events occur. The application design must allow for 
  
 communications situations that occur in real life in call centers, such as peak times when all the lines are busy or 
 power users who switch back and forth between several calls on hold. Users have come to expect almost 
 instantaneous response times from their telephone systems; the CTI application designer must now deliver on that 
 expectation. In this simple model, call control expects the application to act as if it were a telephone set (anything that 
 a telephone could do, the application can now do). By extending that model to include the features of a modern 
 business telephone (multiline, speed call, displays, etc.), the power of this basic service becomes apparent.
  
 There are two approaches to call control:
  
 ●     
 First-party call control
  
 ●     
 Third-party call control",NA
First-party call control,"The basic premise of first-party call control is that the CTI application is acting on behalf of one user. In this model, 
 the application is running on the user's desktop PC, and there is an actual physical connection between the 
 application, the user's PC, and the user's telephone line. 
  
 Through an application, the user can control the telephone call. Examples of these applications include the following:
  
 ●     
 Personal directory
  
 ●     
 Personal organizer
  
 ●     
 Personal answering machine
  
 ●     
 Personal call accounting",NA
Third-party call control,"The basic premise of third-party call control is that the CTI application acts on behalf of any of the clients in a 
 workgroup or department. In this model, the application is running on a shared server and there is no direct physical 
 connection between the user's PC and the telephone line. Instead, there is a ""logical"" connection: The user's PC 
 application communicates with the server, which in turn controls the switch. The server provides a coordination point 
 for all calls being handled in the workgroup. This makes possible a much more powerful (or useful) level of call 
 control. The central server-based application can handle the distribution of all calls to the members of the workgroup, 
 including activities like call screening or back-up answering. This has been a key element in the application of CTI—
 the potential for 
  
 breakthrough productivity gains when used in high-performance workgroups
 .",NA
Call monitoring,"Both of the call control models described previously expect the application to act like a telephone. This is helpful in 
 explaining call control, but it clearly ignores the range of capabilities of a PC. Recognizing this, the designers of CTI 
 built in services, such as call monitors, that capitalize on the strengths of the PC.",NA
Feature activation,"The last of the basic CTI services described in this section is 
 feature activation.
  Modern PBX systems provide over 
 200 features to improve call handling, although the majority of users never use more than 4 of them. The use of PC-
 based applications (which can be set to the user's preferences) unlocks the power already built into the telephone 
 system by allowing simple computer screen-based control of features, such as arranging a conference call by clicking 
 on the names of the parties involved.
  
 In this application, commands are provided that activate, suspend, or turn off features within the switch. For 
 example, the 
 personal organizer
  application could set up call forwarding for a user who is away from the office and 
 turn off the same call forwarding when the user returns. Similarly, a CTI application could modify call screening by 
 a secretary on behalf of a workgroup. It would be turned off at the end of the business day and the calls would be 
 automatically redirected to an answering service.",NA
2.4 CTI in the call center,"Earlier in this chapter, CTI was described from the perspective of a PBX environment, because the technology 
 originated in the PBX community. In a call center application, the PBX switch is capable of relaying information that 
 the PC can interpret and that operators can use to respond to a caller rapidly. CTI is the technology that enables a 
 range of multifaceted call management features to be implemented in a call center. Advances in telephone and 
 computer technology, as well as in other technologies, such as data warehousing and database management 
 systems, have resulted in the increasing sophistication of modern call centers.",NA
Open systems and standards,"As described previously, CTI is made possible by the integration of many different components, subsystems, 
 applications, and technologies and is based on an ""open system"" concept. Open systems and common standards 
 allow a telephony server to be added to an existing LAN, thereby making possible the sharing of applications across 
 an enterprise. In this environment, legacy systems also play a major role by providing customer data and employing 
 other long-standing internal corporate standards. CTI applications can share LANs with different servers because 
 telephony APIs have been developed by leading network specialists and customer premise equipment (CPE) 
 manufacturers. Although CTI came from ""closed proprietary"" roots, its evolution has motivated the 
 telecommunications community to adopt an open system/multivendor environment, a process referred to previously 
 in this chapter.
  
 The integration of computing and telephony, with its myriad of components and standards, is a natural environment 
 for this approach in which numerous players can contribute knowledge and expertise at the right point in the process. 
 On the computer side of the CTI house, major computer vendors are active in client/server architecture and CTI 
 solutions. At the same time, switch vendors have endorsed two of the more prevalent APIs—TSAPI and TAPI (see 
 the Glossary in 
 Appendix B
 ). The significant advantage of open system architectures is that 
  
 they provide developers the opportunity to focus on designing the application, rather than getting involved in the 
 various components or peripherals it may try to control. Application development in CTI is facilitated using APIs 
 provided by operating system designers and manufacturers of peripheral equipment, while CTI developers are 
 free to concentrate on their own application requirements.",NA
The fully automated call center,"Previous descriptions of CTI in this chapter have stressed the high level of automation this hybrid technology brings 
 to call center operations. To accomplish the goals of an organization planning to implement a fully automated call 
 center, the following must be considered and evaluated:
  
 ●     
 Integrating the new CTI architecture with currently installed systems and incorporating the capability for future 
 growth
  
 ●     
 Minimizing requirements for new hardware and software on existing PCs and in the PBX
  
 ●     
 Incorporating industry-standard hardware and software
  
 ●     
 Building in the capability to track and report on call center operations, including operator productivity and the 
 effectiveness of the CTI implementation
  
 An effective call center operation will keep pace with the communications preferences of customers, while maximizing 
 network resources and customer service, by integrating a wide range of communication tools with the organization's 
 human resources and databases.",NA
Switch links and PBX,"Early CTI implementations that used switch links had a number of designations for the link or interface between the 
 computer and the PBX, but what they had in common was architecture rooted in computer-to-mainframe PBX. This 
 complex, high-end system was the result of technology alliances between big switch manufacturers and big computer 
 manufacturers, which yielded an enterprisewide solution. In a typical large call center operation, the application ran 
 on a minicomputer/mainframe and controlled a PBX using an intelligent link. The user's screen was controlled by the 
 same application so that the application could coordinate the call arriving at the desk with the proper and timely",NA

Enhanced CTI services,"Telecom servers extend the range of services available to the CTI application developer. Basic call control can now 
 be integrated with DSP (digital signal processor) cards to deliver the broad range of services described next.",NA
Voice processing—voice mail/automated attendant,"Voice response systems were discussed briefly as one of the call-handling features enabled by CTI. This feature 
 involves a single-card voice mail system that is designed by programming a DSP resource card to compress the 
 caller's voice so that it can be stored on a mass storage device such as a hard disk. The voice is already in digital 
 format when it arrives from the digital trunk or digital line card. The application software in a voice mail server is 
 basically a simple file-and-retrieval system available from several vendors that uses a desktop PC application to 
 control the system.",NA
IVR (interactive voice response),"IVR systems use essentially the same technology as voice mail and can be designed with a single DSP card. IVR 
 applications allow users to create structured scripts that guide the caller through a series of menu options to obtain a 
 final response. The IVR will play digitally stored messages and solicit a response from the caller at each step, 
 generally using a Touch-Tone telephone pad. The response will then cause the next set of messages to be played, 
 according to the script.",NA
Speech recognition,"Speech recognition is another DSP-based technology that can be delivered to the server as a resource card. It gives 
 the computer the capability to analyze digitized voice signals, compare them with other voice patterns, and recognize 
 the words being spoken. This technology can be used to supplement IVR systems in situations where the user can't 
 use the Touch-Tone keypad or to reduce the number of menus that the caller has to navigate.",NA
Text-to-speech technology,"Text-to-speech or speech synthesis technologies are another resource card option, enabling the computer to 
 produce speech from written or spoken information. This capability is useful for e-mail or free-form messages when a 
 terminal is unavailable (e.g., at the airport, on a cellular phone, etc.)",NA
Fax processing,NA,NA
Media conversion ,"Media conversion, along with other technologies, has the potential to improve access to information from 
 anywhere, a useful feature for mobile workforces.",NA
Optical character recognition (OCR) ,"OCR is another DSP-based technology that converts a scanned image into text. When used with fax images, it can 
 convert an incoming fax to a document that can be edited or pass it to a text-to-speech application to be read aloud.

2.5 CTI implementation guidelines,"The implementation of a CTI solution begins with the selection of an overall system architecture. One of two options 
 may be selected:
  
 ●     
 Traditional mainframe level (enterprise)
  
 ●     
 Workgroup (client/server) level external to existing telecommunications switches and infrastructure
  
 These options represent two philosophically different approaches to CTI. The advantages and disadvantages of each 
 are described next.",NA
Implementation at enterprise or PBX level,"The enterprise or PBX level requires additional intelligence in the PBX. Considerable time and expense will be 
 required to upgrade the software and hardware, however, possibly requiring complete replacement of the PBX. In 
 addition, the existing proprietary software used for call control and call processing, as well as the complex 
 interactions between call processing and the features and functions accessible through desktop telephones, may not 
 be capable of upgrading, thus requiring a complete system upgrade.",NA
Implementation at client/server or LAN level,"At the client/server or LAN level, integration is accomplished by the addition of an applications or telephony server 
 to the existing LAN architecture. As a result, the legacy PBX investment is maintained and CTI functionality is 
 delivered by another server on the LAN. The server takes control of telephone calls and serves as the interface 
 between telephony protocols, server software, and the clients using the applications.
  
 Once the implementation alternative has been selected, a key business parameter related to the implementation of 
 CTI, and more importantly, to the objectives and goals of a call center operation, must be addressed. This is the 
 overall enterprise objective for customer interaction,
  or in more current terminology, the corporation's 
 customer 
 relationship management
  (
 CRM
 ) strategy. (see 
 Chapter 6
 ). Assessing the impact of CTI on this strategy means 
 evaluating every possible contingency and every possible combination of 
  
 customer communication, including e-mail, telephone, Website hits, fax, and even regular (snail) mail. The correct 
 CTI process or product is the appropriate mix of applications and core technologies that add value to a company's 
 existing operations and allow it to do more to enhance its CRM strategy.
  
 A number of specific CTI applications may be considered at the evaluation stage for their contribution to meeting call 
 center objectives:
  
 ●     
 Voice mail
  
 ●     
 Unified messaging
  
 ●     
 Advanced call routing
  
 ●     
 Fax redirection
  
 ●     
 Internet telephony
  
 ●     
 Call center applications
  
 ●     
 Customer service software
  
 ●     
 Salesforce automation
  
 Once the CTI implementation option has been selected, there are several logical, practical approaches to meeting 
 the specified requirements. The 12-step, chronological CTI Project Checklist described next is a process that has 
 been tested in the development of successful call centers. It is flexible in that it can be modified to meet specific 
 requirements and is applicable to either of the implementation options.",NA
The 12-step CTI project checklist,file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0013.html (1 von 5) [20.09.2007 19:03:08],NA
Selection and integration of CTI components ,"Putting the pieces of a CTI system together involves a high degree of coordination between products and vendors at 
 several levels. Once the 12-step project checklist has been completed, the project team can move into the actual 
 implementation stage, in which equipment is assembled, tested, and proven and the pilot site is brought to an 
 operational state. The fundamental hardware and the integration elements are the foundation, including
  
  
 ●     
 Boards that process voice and data channels, servers, and networks that meet specifications for high reliability 
 and reflect mission 
  
 criticality
  
  
 ●     
 Middleware—the standards and open protocols that interconnect equipment from different vendors 
  
 The other major components are
  
  
 ●     
 Hardware elements
  
  
 ●     
 Dual networking infrastructures—phone switch and data network
  
  
 ●     
 Application layer
  
 The phone switches are usually PBXs or dedicated high-volume call-routing switches called 
 automatic call 
 distributors
  (ACDs). These devices are described in detail later in this chapter.",NA
Middleware,"Between the phone and data networking areas lies the middleware layer. Originally, many middleware products 
 focused on interconnecting a single vendor switch and a single host format. Older and more widespread databases 
 involve more complex middleware, which gave rise to many problems in implementing CTI. These problems occurred 
 because companies with old legacy systems and extremely customized databases had to endure a difficult period of 
 customization of switch-to-database interfaces before they could achieve the benefits of CTI. The incorporation of 
 middleware connectivity in the switch is eliminating this technological hurdle and making call center development 
 easier.",NA
Application layer,"The next level of product in the CTI hierarchy is the 
 application layer,
  the software that actually makes people more 
 productive, providing features such as messaging or speech recognition, automating salesforces, or taking orders 
 over the Web. When considering a transition to CTI, it is important to start with a concrete idea of what the system 
 should accomplish by identifying the applications that suit the business and then to build up and down to integrate 
 those applications with the existing infrastructure.",NA
Consulting services and systems integration,"There are consulting services and systems integration knowledge and expertise available that can assist an 
 organization to integrate all of the elements of CTI. Generally speaking, CTI is not an off-the-shelf system. It 
 requires the interconnection of different technical realms that are usually managed by different departments and 
 personnel having different mindsets and priorities. Because of the inevitable and often unforeseen problems 
 associated with integrating the two core technologies, making CTI work can be a challenge, despite the best efforts 
 of standards committees and vendors to make the process easier. As well, there are many things that can't be 
 anticipated by outsiders, which is another key reason to have an internally directed plan rather than hand everything 
 over to a consultant or a systems integrator.
  
 Many companies need help defining the scope of what CTI should do in a business context (not just from a technical 
 point of view). Consultants or systems integrators familiar with the business environment may be able to coordinate 
 the entire implementation plan, help select the products from the various layers, and, if necessary, create any custom 
 linkages or applications to suit the situation. As noted previously, vendor assistance may also be available, a 
 resource that is becoming more viable as the vendor community develops better knowledge of CTI and its 
 components in order to provide end-to-end coverage of the entire CTI process, from the component layer through the 
 applications service. Vendors often set up umbrella systems through application partners from which a customer can 
 choose a variety of applications that are precertified by the vendor to work with selected hardware.
  
 Before deciding on implementing any computer telephony technology in the call center, the internal environment 
 must be defined. One rule of thumb that may be applied is that 
 areas with high volume are going to have the highest 
 payback when implementing open applications.",NA
Guidelines for the 12-point CTI project checklist,"As additional support for the 12-point checklist, the following guidelines will assist call center development teams 
 to assess and meet their requirements.",NA
Size up your host solution,"LANs, minis or mainframes? For smaller centers, a local area network can serve as the entire host side of the 
 solution. Recently, application development and the experience of established call centers have shown that a LAN-
 based or client/server-based application provides more flexibility for importing telephone functions to the workstation. 
 If there is already a mainframe or mini in place, use the existing hardware. These systems may be used as host 
 servers and connected to workstations via local area networks, combining the flexibility of a LAN with the processing 
 power of a mainframe.",NA
Confirm savings and goals with vendors as part of the selection process,"Before contacting vendors, evaluate the time and cost of handling a given call. Compare this information to the 
 vendor's proposal, in order to calculate projected savings. Demand detailed projections and scenarios, and ask to 
 speak to a few happy customers. Even among happy customers you may find some potential drawbacks to a 
 particular system.

Consult colleagues about their call center experiences,"In noncompetitive situations, colleagues can be valuable sources of information on open applications they may have 
 implemented.",NA
Start over or improve on existing applications?,"If a call center is being upgraded, many applications can be integrated without difficulty into an open CTI 
 environment. For example, an application that calls up customer profile information by having the CSR key in the 
 customer's Social Security number can be replaced using ANI in which the open application automatically summons 
 the field to the agent's screen by replacing the Social Security number with a home phone number. Many open 
 applications, like predictive dialing engines, are more efficient or economical if purchased as turnkey applications. In 
 this situation, it is more practical to keep the existing application than to attempt to adapt a new one.",NA
Develop a test program,"There are two ways to test computer telephony applications prior to full implementation. Dummy applications are 
 available that simulate call traffic, the workforce, the planned equipment, network services, and application programs. 
 A test region can also be made available on the host platform where pilot tests can be run while changes are being 
 made and load analysis is being performed. Many telecom managers prefer to phase in the new regime gradually 
 using such separate testing areas, for example, phasing in 10 or 20% of the customer base, then gradually 
 broadening the application to include the entire base throughout the call center.",NA
Avoid fancy features that do not really contribute to productivity,"Some CTI applications can perform feats so stunning that even the most conservative telecom center manager can 
 get carried away.",NA
Provide appropriate training for CSRs,"Plan and organize training sessions, coordinated by the applications developer, on new applications well in advance 
 of the installation so that CSRs can master them before they are implemented. Keep in mind that the introduction of 
 automation into any process involving human resources means fewer employees are required. Perhaps the budget 
 will permit the diversion of CSRs to a larger support group or complaint division; otherwise, the call center workforce 
 may have to be reduced through attrition or layoffs.",NA
Be prepared to implement new evaluation criteria for CSRs,"If an application incorporates a voice response unit, for example, the unit will handle most of the simple inquiries 
 without any live intervention. This means that CSRs will handle only the more difficult calls, and therefore the duration 
 of calls fielded by CSRs will increase while the number of calls handled will decrease.",NA
Conduct reality checks,"Evaluate each new application 3 months after it is in place and again in 12 months to determine if cost savings have 
 been achieved. It is relatively easy to calculate lower toll-free usage and the savings resulting from fewer CSRs 
 staffing phones, but other benefits are more difficult to gauge. For example, in an insurance application, it is difficult to 
 determine how many new policies have been purchased simply because the CSR was able to transfer both the data 
 file and the screen immediately from the life insurance division to the accident group. These reality checks may 
 require altering long-distance contracts, CSR scheduling, and even computer capacity to accommodate a changed 
 call processing environment to generate real cost savings. Incorporating changes of this nature will result in a faster 
 return on investment. The experience of some call center users indicates that the payback period on investment 
 ranges from 9 to 16 months.",NA

Managing information effectively with ACDs ,"As call centers have evolved, a number of changes have affected the ACD and its functions. The ACD is 
 responsible for more than moving or routing calls; it also 
 manages the information associated with those calls.
  The 
 ACD function is performed by a variety of different kinds of processors.
  
 The following ACD options are offered by vendors:
  
  
 ●

ACDs: all shapes and sizes,"ACD functionality is available in a wide range of telephone switches that vary in size and sophistication. Earlier 
 versions of ACDs were very specific types of telephone switches with highly specialized features and particularly 
 robust call-processing capabilities that served at least 100 stations (or extensions). One of the primary applications 
 was in airline reservation centers. Among the various types of ACDs available to the modern call center are the 
 following:

 PC-based ACDs

 Nationwide networks of ACDs",NA
ACD functions and features,"There is simply no technology more suited to routing a large number of inbound calls to a large number of people 
 than an ACD. The ACD ensures that calls are answered as quickly as possible, and it can provide special services for 
 selected customers. ACDs are capable of handling call rates and volumes far exceeding human capabilities and the 
 capabilities of other telecom switches. They provide a high degree of call-processing horsepower and augment 
 human resources very effectively. An ACD provides the resources to manage the many parts of the call center, from 
 telephone trunks to CSR stations and from callers to CSRs and other staff members.
  
 Despite the availability of all of these call-handling options in a variety of open and modular products, some 
 organizations still prefer an expensive, stand-alone ACD in their call centers, for two reasons:
  
 1.  
 Power
 —a first-tier stand-alone system has a tremendous call-processing power, and no other product is 
 so uniquely suited to 
  
 meeting the needs of the larger megacenters found in the reservations or financial 
 service sectors.
  
 2.  
 Technology
 —integration with other call center systems, IVR, data warehouses, and intranets is 
 significantly easier with a 
  
 powerhouse ACD. This is also true for multisite networking and skills-based 
 routing, two of the most popular inbound features.
  
 Smaller systems—PC-ACDs and PBX/ACD hybrids—which account for much of the industry's phenomenal growth 
 in small centers, have their place in the range of call center solutions. However, for high-volume applications there 
 is no substitute for the call-managing power of the stand-alone ACD.
  
 Vendors are providing stand-alone ACDs in several different ways. Some acquire the technology envelope with their 
 switches, while others concentrate on software development to add value to the core switch. Still others are paying 
 more attention to integration with third-party call center technologies like the Internet and IVR. Some are adapting 
 their switches to smaller, departmental call centers in an effort to capture some market share in this call center 
 segment. The benefit to the user community is that there are a number of options available from vendors for installing 
 ACD functionality.",NA
New challenges for the ACD,"The role of the ACD is changing because of two significant, current trends in call center operations. ACDs are 
 required to channel more information, of many different kinds, in more directions. In earlier call center models, the 
 ACD handled two kinds of information: the call itself 
  
 file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0014.html (2 von 5) [20.09.2007 19:03:09]",NA
Alternative methods of call delivery,"Another dynamic change concerns the kinds of calls the system has to route. Call centers have been integrating 
 ACDs with IVR and fax communication for a long time. Systems now have to integrate Websites and the Internet with 
 calls that come in from PCs and that terminate in databases instead of with CSRs. As a result, the call center is now 
 being referred to by a broader, more appropriate term that better describes its enhanced scope and current role in 
 this age of technology: 
 the contact center for customer communication,
  which recognizes that the transaction 
 between the customer and the company is what is important, not the communication medium and the process that 
 carries the transaction.",NA
Skills-based routing,"Skills-based routing is another advanced feature that has changed the role of the ACD. This feature was added by 
 switch designers because it was an interesting and available technology that could be added easily to a switch, not 
 because call centers were clamoring for it. Unfortunately, it has taken a long time for call centers to understand and to 
 derive benefit from this feature, because skills-based routing has some negative aspects involving the proper use of 
 workforce management software. Nevertheless, skills-based routing is a very interesting advanced technology for 
 distributing calls handled by an ACD. Traditional routing is based on two factors—an equitable distribution of calls 
 among available agents and the random nature of incoming calls. Skills-based routing changes this by routing calls to 
 the ""best-qualified"" CSR, using individual call center parameters to define this attribute.
  
 The ACD routes calls in two stages, the first being to identify the needs of the caller using some front-end 
 technology. This operation is usually accomplished through a DNIS, ANI, or an IVR system. Once the caller is 
 identified, the information is matched against the sets of CSR skill groups. Two advances in ACD technology allow 
 skills-based routing to operate effectively:
  
 ●     
 Leaving a call in an initial queue while simultaneously and continuously checking other CSR groups for 
 availability
  
 ●     
 Allowing a CSR to be logged on to more than one skills group at a time, assigning priorities to those groups by 
 skill type
  
 Corporate requirements to link call centers together into multisite call center networks have caused changes in call 
 routing to be implemented at a faster pace. This development can be viewed as an extension of skills-based routing, 
 because in some situations, it is not enough to select the best available agent; it may be desirable to select the best 
 available agent at the most appropriate location, based on factors such as
  
 ●     
 Skill clusters
  
 ●     
 Call priority
  
 ●     
 Time of day
  
 ●     
 Traffic at one or more sites",NA
Requirements for small centers,NA,NA
ACD rules of thumb,"It is less expensive to incorporate ACD features into an existing business phone system—there is no capital 
 expenditure on a large piece of hardware. There are also rules of thumb for the number of agents per ACD. At the 
 level of 6 CSRs, or even up to 30 agents, it is difficult to justify large ACDs. However, systems and products are much 
 more flexible than they used to be, and it is now relatively easy to integrate top-notch systems like interactive voice 
 response or voice mail, giving a small center a very professional appearance to customers.
  
 Another feature critical to call center operations is third-party call control. Third-party call control can, for example, 
 provide special treatment to customers based on the language they speak and call routing can be accomplished 
 based on skill sets or on time of day for full 24-hour coverage. Using the PC, it is not difficult to set up a rules-based 
 system for directing the right call to the right CSR. This has become a low-end solution for small call centers.
  
 The PBX/ACD allows an organization to implement a call center in stages; however, a low-end ACD in a PBX 
 switch will only allow a facility to grow to a certain point—here the rule of thumb is about 50 CSRs. At this point, it 
 will be necessary to explore larger, stand-alone ACDs. 
  
 Low-end systems should be evaluated for their upgrade capabilities. Vendors can now offer systems that can be 
 upgraded smoothly in stages, a result of their efforts to capture some share of the small call center market. PC/ACDs 
 or PBX/ACDs may handle smaller centers—typically, 10 to 15 CSRs—very well, placing them on the same 
 technological level as bigger centers. Organizations that already have in-house PBXs can experiment with available 
 ACD software. A commonly used technique is to convert a few users, and if this conversion works well, to expand the 
 availability of the ACD function to other CSRs.
  
 In addition, there are software products available (see 
 Appendix A
 ) that allow overflow patterns to be set among 
 multiple small groups and 
  
 that also allow these parameters to be changed quickly, with a minimum of software knowledge. These systems do 
 not deliver the same functionality as a dedicated ACD, but in many situations that is not necessary. Departmental 
 needs differ—for example, few need multisite routing—and department heads may need reports on sales and costs 
 rather than call traffic.
  
 It is interesting to note that many small ""call centers"" have not realized that they are call centers! Once they are 
 recognized as call centers, these facilities, need the same kind of technologies that larger ones have been using for 
 several years. After all, customers demand the same high service standards, no matter how big or how small the 
 organization. The small-scale ACD solution allows small organizations to obtain a much higher level of customer 
 relationship management at a reasonable cost.",NA
Networking ACDs,"One change in switching technology is the use of the network itself as a platform for queuing and routing even after 
 a call has been answered. Call-routing systems that let the call center perform ACD-style call flow manipulations 
 directly within the network are available from some vendors. This system works well with a variety of phone 
 switches and carrier networks. It has the advantage of turning a collection of linked calls into a true, single ""virtual"" 
 center. The switch data is processed by intelligent query services, which direct the carrier where to send the call 
 before it enters the switchboard. Network-based call routing works in conjunction with routing schemes that may 
 already be in use, such as CSR skills and time-based routing, ANI, or caller-entered information, just as if the CSRs 
 were working with a single-site ACD. Networking also allows these techniques to be applied across varied and 
 remote sites.",NA
Switching and routing systems,file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0014.html (4 von 5) [20.09.2007 19:03:09],NA
Open system products,"One of the most important aspects of some of the more recent call center products, from a user perspective, is that 
 they are ""open system"" products. This means that they will work with other ACDs, interface on the network side with 
 existing IT and telecom infrastructures, and are easy to integrate into existing systems. The advantage to ""Webifying"" 
 an existing call center seat is that it allows the organization to leverage trained CSRs and equipment to sell existing 
 products, no matter how complex, to a ""Web lurker,"" who might not even have been an overt caller. Converting these 
 Web lurkers into callers is the first step in turning them into customers.
  
 Some vendor organizations are attempting to assemble an end-to-end, all-in-one call center system. The concept of 
 the ""call center in a box"" has been popular for some time; however, the complexity and variety of call center 
 technologies make it unlikely that a single vendor will be able to create and ""shrink-wrap"" a complete hardware and 
 software application to meet all call center requirements. What has evolved in the marketplace is a collection of 
 integrated applications from which to choose that are certified to meet the required specifications under the 
 management and control of a single vendor.
  
 Competition among switch vendors serving the call center market has created a growing portfolio of technology that 
 is often very interesting and innovative but does not really meet real-world functional requirements and therefore has 
 not become part of the established set of operational tools. Among the examples of this exotic technology are some 
 that have been discussed previously, including skills-based routing and universal agent blending; ""call-me"" buttons on 
 Web pages are also in this category. The more exotic technology has not found a place in call center operations 
 because of the many operational and cultural hurdles to their implementation and application in real-life call centers.
  
 The considerable degree of competition among vendors on product features and the high cost of development have 
 also led larger companies to add value to their switch products through aggressive acquisition strategies. Small 
 companies find a multivendor environment very costly; they must spend huge sums of money on marketing to bring 
 their products to the attention of call centers. Under these circumstances, partnerships among vendors proliferate.",NA
2.7 The Internet in the call center,"A discussion of networks in the call center would not be complete without mentioning the significance and dramatic 
 growth of the largest and most extensive network in the world—the Internet—which is available to the public and 
 becoming increasingly important to the business community. It is hard to grasp how the Internet became so important 
 to business in such a short time, and how dramatically it has changed many of the rules of conducting business. It 
 has provided alternatives for how to work, where to work, how to communicate, how to keep informed, and how to 
 communicate with customers. All of these aspects of the Internet have an impact on call center operations.
  
 Customers have choices for how they communicate, and there are a number of them—some would say too many! 
 There will always be some companies that want to stick to the older business models, but they will gradually be 
 replaced because they will no longer be competitive. 
  
 (see 
 Figure 2.9
 )
  
  
 Figure 2.9: 
 Multidimensional customer contact. 
  
 In the context of the Internet, the call center is revolutionary. Call centers are automated service delivery points, full 
 of customer data and products, dedicated to one major objective: providing customers with whatever services or 
 products they require. How does the Internet fit into the call center model? It is just one more communication 
 channel for the customer, a channel that call centers need to manage at least as well as traditional communication 
 channels.
  
 The Internet is a relatively low-cost communication channel, easy to establish and manage and using many of the 
 same network and communication infrastructures as the traditional communication channels. It provides a range of 
 opportunities to CSRs operating from sites remote from the ""home"" call center and to customers with Internet 
 connections on their home and office desktops. In this ""cyberworld,"" each customer has the equivalent of the CSR 
 terminal and can be provided with the same information as the CSR. However, CSRs must be in place to assist and 
 guide customers who want to talk to a real person. The CSR represents the company's interests in a sales 
 transaction and may pull or push the customer toward a product and (possibly) away from a problem. Customers 
 usually need guidance at some point in a transaction, no matter how much information they have obtained from a 
 Website. There may be confusing options or other procedures to be followed that need explaining, and the CSR can 
 assure customers that their needs will be looked after.",NA
Integrating the Internet into the call center,NA,NA
Text-based interaction,"Real-time, text-based interaction also demonstrates the power and capability of the Internet in the call center. In this 
 scenario, a caller connects to a Website and asks for a CSR's assistance using a chat window. Removing the 
 hardware and bandwidth necessary for voice communication permits live interaction, or what at least appears live to 
 the caller. One benefit is that the CSR in the center can handle multiple callers at once because of the delay 
 inherent in chat mode and can use scripts to speed up responses. The CSR is also able to guide the caller to a 
 particular Web screen, share information, and participate fully in bringing a transaction to a successful close. 
 Another, major benefit of this model is that the Internet/call center connection is moved from the service side to the 
 sales side, and at a level of technology that is available to smaller companies. CSRs can guide a Web surfer to a 
 sale or the next level of the sales process at the same cost savings as the more complex ""call-me button"" model of 
 Web interaction. This is also one of the features available in call center/Internet integration but one yet to be 
 accepted by call center managers, for reasons noted earlier.
  
 The choice of which of the several methods of integrating the Internet into the call center for each organization will 
 depend on several factors: the resources available, the comfort level with transitional technology, and, most 
 importantly, the relationship between a company and its customers. (see 
 Figure 2.10
 )
  
  
 Figure 2.10: 
 Data sources and customer interactions.",NA
2.8 Database management technology,"This section provides an overview of database management systems, in particular the relational database 
 management systems (RDBMS) that are a component of most data warehousing systems, the technology that 
 enables vast amounts of customer data to be stored, some of which will ultimately end up on the CSR's screen in a 
 call center. This overview is not intended to be a definitive or detailed analysis of database technology; however, it 
 does provide some selection criteria for and characteristics of this technology. The material is included in this book 
 to illustrate its importance in the overall process of providing customer information to call centers.
  
 Data mining, the process of extracting customer data from the data warehouse, is also reviewed and described, 
 as is the importance of ensuring that only ""clean"" data are provided to the data warehouse.
  
 Database management software is the technology that manages the data stored in the data warehouse and provides 
 the tools for accessing and querying the data. In combination with the data warehouse, the repository of customer 
 transaction data, this technology enables organizations to store, access, and manipulate customer data and to 
 provide call center CSRs access to the data. (see 
 Figure 2.11
 )
  
  
 Figure 2.11: 
 Data mining tools.",NA
Database alternatives,"There are several viable database management systems used in data warehousing. However, as is typical of the IT 
 sector, vendors often offer products that are in the final development stages and ready for first release. There are, 
 therefore, usually implementation glitches and code that doesn't work in these products.
  
 Determining database requirements is one of the critical areas of data warehousing, and the impact of their selection 
 will filter down to the call center, one way or another. Organizations often tend to select a database with the rationale 
 that it is the ""company standard,"" because it is expedient and it eliminates the need for support IS staff to learn 
 another database. However, the selection of database products should follow the same rigorous evaluation process 
 as for any other IT product. Database management software should be selected on its own merits, that is, because it 
 meets the objectives of the type of data warehouse to be implemented—
 operational data warehouse
  or 
 informational 
 data warehouse
 —and for its contribution to the corporate CRM strategy.
  
 Most RDBMSs are based on on-line transaction processing. These products can handle operational data warehouses 
 and have short but high transactional volumes, a response time requirement, and a very limited amount of historical 
 data. These characteristics contrast very clearly with database requirements for the informational data warehouse, 
 which has low transactional volumes, no real response-time requirement, and a large amount of historical data. The 
 access characteristics of these two data warehouse environments are completely different. Database management 
 systems need to differentiate between these two types of data warehouses, so it is important when selecting the 
 RDBMS to be aware of its architecture for providing effective data access to either or even both data warehouse 
 configurations.",NA
Data mining,"Data mining and analytical tools, in combination with the data warehouse and database management technology, 
 assist in increasing the return on investment (ROI) on stored customer data. In addition, they allow organizations to 
 understand customer behavior patterns, rather than just grouping or segmenting them according to products they 
 buy, age, or other personal characteristics, and highlight cross-selling opportunities and pinpoint the most profitable 
 client profiles. These characteristics of the RDBMS are important to call center CSRs because they determine the 
 ease of access and the usefulness of the customer data they will use in their day-to-day activities.",NA
Integrating customer data and the call center,"The information that can be gathered from the data warehouse and the RDBMS should form a ready source of 
 customer data for the call center as well as provide information to marketing and salesforce automation programs. 
 Conversely, customer information obtained in the call center should be continually fed back into the data 
 repository. The more integrated the process, the closer the organization is to achieving one of the key objectives 
 of a CRM strategy: 
 a single view of the customer throughout the organization.",NA
Data standards,"Standards are necessary for the data stored in the data warehouse—consistent formatting reduces complications for 
 data extraction. 
  
 Ensuring that the highest quality of data is provided at the input stage promotes acceptance of the data and 
 develops a high degree of confidence in it. Many corporate CRM strategies are thwarted by faulty, inconsistent data 
 that prevent users from having a clear, unified profile of each customer. Disjointed data, blanks in some of the 
 critical fields, and broken business rules are a few of the ways in which data can be corrupted, resulting in data 
 integrity problems.
  
 Integrating customer datasets is a challenge for any organization that wants to achieve a single view of the customer. 
 Various departments—call centers, ordering, shipping, manufacturing, sales, and marketing—have customer contact 
 and therefore customer information to contribute to the database. In a typical financial institution or insurance 
 company, for example, there could be 50 to 150 different systems containing customer data. To have a single view of 
 each customer to establish value levels and to meet customer needs, this data must be combined and integrated. 
 Combining and integrating data to obtain a complete, current customer profile requires assembling different data 
 stores, with data of varying ages, on different databases, and usually involving multiple programming languages and 
 data formats. Vendor software is available that can assist in assembling and profiling data, as well as analyzing data 
 before it gets stored in the data warehouse. 
  
 Typically, these products locate different relationships in customer data from multiple sources, 
 irrespective of source code and documentation, and provide information on how to clean and restructure 
 the data.",NA
Data clustering,"Cluster analysis is an exploratory data analysis tool that uses statistical algorithms to identify distinct groups of 
 customers that may not traditionally group together. It is used in segmentation not only to independently validate 
 business assumptions but also to discover new interrelationships between variables that were previously not 
 associated. This technique may be useful in call centers that have an outbound call requirement that targets certain 
 demographics in a customer population.",NA
2.9 Summary,"This chapter has provided a detailed description of several important call center technologies, the features and 
 services they provide, and the benefits they offer to call center operations. One thing that stands out about 
 technology is that it is in a constant stage of transition, and today's advanced technology may be passé tomorrow. 
 For call center developers and mangers, it is important to maintain an open mind on technology and to be always 
 ready to examine, evaluate, and implement appropriate technologies that will assist in meeting call center and 
 corporate CRM strategies.",NA

3.1 Overview,"The turn of the 20th century was the dawn of a new age in communications. A few decades earlier, in 1876, the 
 telephone had been invented and telephone service was proliferating rapidly. As telephone services expanded, the 
 public began to depend on and even expect reliable service from telecommunication providers.
  
 As the subscriber base grew, telephone companies were contending with new resource-planning problems. 
 Automated central offices hadn't yet been invented, so human operators were required to establish connections for 
 callers. One big question was how many telephone operators were necessary to run the switchboard. Too few and 
 service levels would be unacceptable to callers. But too many would be inefficient for telephone companies and 
 would drive up costs for subscribers. Further complicating the issue was the fact that calls arrived randomly, driven by 
 the myriad of motivations individual callers had for placing calls. (see 
 Figure 3.1
 )
  
  
 Figure 3.1: 
 Typical call center infrastructure. 
  
 In the years that followed, many bright people would grapple with these resource-management challenges. One of 
 the first was A. K. Erlang, an engineer with the Copenhagen Telephone Company, who in 1917 developed the 
 queuing formula Erlang C. The formula is still widely used today in incoming call centers for calculating staffing 
 requirements and is described in greater detail later in this chapter. Others who followed Erlang focused on 
 developing disciplined forecasting techniques, scheduling methodologies, and system report parameters; advances in 
 the development of forecasting and scheduling methodologies continue to be made.",NA
The management challenge,"Managing a call center operation successfully requires a multitude of skills-managerial, troubleshooting, negotiating, 
 and patience, not to mention a personality that works well under pressure and is able to handle the different types of 
 CSRs who will work at the facility over time. Some familiarity with computer and communications technologies is an 
 asset as well, although most internal call center facilities should have ready access to technical support for resolving 
 hardware, software, and communications problems. The steady growth in the call center industry over the past 10 
 years has resulted in a requirement for new job-related management skills. As call center personnel have developed 
 these skills, the position of call center manager has evolved and is now a portable, definable position, recognized 
 from company to company and across different sectors of industry.
  
 The global growth of call centers as a significant element of customer-centered business has led to the employment 
 of a large number of people in call centers, estimated to be between 3 and 4 million, in North America alone. From a 
 labor market perspective, the industry is not saturated, since the growth of call centers outpaces the supply of 
 employees. Historically, the industry has had a difficult time attracting a steady supply of qualified workers. Turnover 
 in the call center industry is a major problem as well. Turnover rates are significantly higher than those of other",NA
Rising staff costs ,"Faced with the requirement of generating a profit, many businesses confront a major problem: rising staff costs. 
 Over the next few years, management of call/contact center staff will move to the forefront of corporate concerns 
 because
  
  
 ●     
 The average call/contact center spends between 60 and 70% of its annual budget on staff salary.
  
 ●     
 Globally, agent turnover rates average 22%, and approach 50% in some industries.
  
 ●     
 Staff absenteeism is increasing and is as high as 17% in the health care industry, 10% in the 
 telecommunications and consumer products markets, and averages 9% across all vertical markets.

3.2 Management guidelines for a productive call center,"Call centers need to tread the thin line between improving service, sales, and revenue on the one hand and 
 controlling costs on the other. When the proper balance is struck by effective management of the call center, the 
 result will be a company that is more efficient and more productive on all levels. To achieve these dual objectives, 
 the cost of hiring, training, and measuring the performance of CSRs needs to be managed carefully.
  
 The significant contribution of the human element to the success or failure of a call center operation, and the statistics 
 just described, present call center managers with the following human resource challenges:
  
 ●     
 Hiring competent, skilled CSRs
  
 ●     
 Establishing competitive salary ranges
  
 ●     
 Motivating and retaining CSRs
  
 ●     
 Measuring CSR performance
  
 ●     
 Maintaining CSR skills through appropriate training
  
 This chapter focuses on the management aspects of call centers, including workforce management practices and 
 processes, including CSR monitoring and performance measurement, call center structure, outsourcing resources, 
 operator scheduling, and contingency and disaster recovery planning.
  
 Chapter 4
 , ""Selecting and Training Call Center Staff,"" provides insight into and more specific guidelines for another 
 human resource aspect 
  
 of call center management—staff selection and training—and the application of proven management techniques to 
 ensure a productive call center environment and the effective management of the all-important human resource.",NA
Workforce management systems (WFM),"One of the most important tools available to call center managers is the 
 workforce management system
  (
 WFM
 ). 
 However, despite the wealth of technology available to manage call center operations and the critical nature of 
 workforce management, workforce management systems are used in only about 10% of call centers, according to 
 industry sources and surveys conducted over the past few years.
  
 The first WFM applications were relatively unsophisticated compared to current products; however, they significantly 
 reduced the time required to do simple agent scheduling. These applications were fed data from the ACD but were 
 normally stand-alone solutions with limited or no integration, which meant the call center scheduler did not have a 
 particularly accurate picture of what needed to be done. The WFM system did not improve the call center managers' 
 knowledge so much as it assisted them in reaching similar conclusions more quickly.
  
 Workforce management in the call center has been defined as 
 ""the art and science of having the right number of 
 CSRs available at the right time, to answer an accurately forecasted volume of incoming calls at the desired service 
 level, with quality.""
  A number of software products are available to accomplish this objective, and their capability to 
 accurately predict call volume and then staff accordingly is very attractive. More call centers should incorporate this 
 software tool to make the task easier. The 10% of call centers that do use workforce management software are 
 among the most advanced call center operations, with high call volumes, extensive use of technology, and high 
 productivity levels. There are reasons why many centers do not use these productivity products, however, including 
 the following.",NA
Cost,"WFM can be expensive; systems that predict call volume and match staff schedules to that volume can cost between 
 $50,000 and $100,000 or more.",NA
High maintenance,"The perception that a fully configured WFM system requires scheduling, feeding data in, going over the data that 
 comes out, and providing full-time supervision of the system may be true in some cases. When a system is complex, 
 more training is required to run it, especially when scheduling and predicting are required across multiple sites.",NA
Cultural barriers,"Greater market penetration faces ""cultural"" barriers, in this case, the culture of the traditional call center where more 
 emphasis is placed on managing the call and its flow through the system than on managing the workforce.",NA
Limited promotion of WFM product capabilities,"Companies that develop and supply WFM software have not provided a complete description of the benefits, 
 perhaps because these vendors do not see the need, or because they do not have the level of competency or 
 industry experience to appreciate the need.",NA
Complexity,"The disparity between the actual complexity required to develop the best possible schedule and the apparent 
 simplicity of creating a schedule is often not recognized.
  
 Call center managers have a range of options for creating a schedule, from a manual, back-of-the envelope 
 calculation to using formulas in a simple spreadsheet with a special calculator to input the center's variables to 
 ultimately using a five- or six-figure full-fledged computer program. Achieving the highest level of workforce 
 productivity does require some powerful software, and it will be expensive.",NA
Workforce management systems for multimedia centers,"WFM solutions will become a key CRM-enabling technology in the multimedia call/contact center. It is an 
 application that may provide a solution to both agent attrition and multimedia staffing. Businesses will be able to 
 provide the right agents to the right customer and to leverage customer segmentation for a superior level of 
 customer service. Without a means of accurately forecasting how much human resource will be needed to keep 
 customers and agents satisfied while keeping costs to a minimum, businesses could have every sophisticated e-
 application available but fail to reach an acceptable service level.
  
 The cost of running a contact/call center is considerable in most enterprises, and the center traditionally has been 
 viewed as a cost center—a necessary evil. This perception has resulted in keeping expenditures on technology, 
 people, and business processes to a minimum. The advent of the CRM approach and its impact on call centers, and 
 vice versa, have meant that leading businesses in sectors such as financial services, retail, and telecommunications 
 are beginning to view their contact centers as profit generators. Revenue growth is encouraged through cross selling 
 and upselling support, and costs are kept low through implementing solutions such as IVR, predictive dialers, and 
 other technologies that have been developed to streamline call center operations.
  
 In the multimedia contact center, as in the traditional call center, the aim of workforce management software is to 
 have the right agents available to help customers at the right time. A sophisticated yet easy-to-use solution, this 
 software has become one of the most useful tools currently available to a call/contact center manager, from both the 
 customer satisfaction and agent retention perspectives. Although WFM is not a total solution, it enables the business 
 to resource the center as it wishes. The key attribute of superior workforce management software is its flexibility, 
 particularly in a multimedia environment. The advent of CRM and multimedia customer contacts means that WFM is 
 destined to play an increasingly important role in most major call/contact centers, supporting both the management of 
 multimedia interactions and also allowing businesses to focus on customers' needs and resource the center 
 effectively.
  
 As previously noted, despite a relatively low profile in the past, interest in workforce management solutions has 
 begun to grow. Leading companies are learning that there are major savings to be realized with WFM as well as 
 opportunities to increase customer and agent satisfaction in a relatively cost-effective manner. Before WFM became 
 available, call center managers spent days at a time working out agent staffing schedules with only a computer 
 spreadsheet to help. A complex task requiring a great degree of skill to perform, the schedule was prone to error 
 through last-minute changes of circumstance, lack of historical data, or plain human mistakes. Even when 
 successfully accomplished, the level of detail and accuracy in the schedule often left something to be desired.",NA
Advanced WFM to support multimedia and CRM,"The primary reason for implementing a new workforce management solution in a call/contact center operation is 
 multimedia contact and CRM. There is much more to implementing a multimedia contact center than simply offering 
 e-mail and various flavors of live CSR assistance. In terms of cost and service levels, if a corporation is not able to",NA
The workforce management cycle,"Fulfilling service levels while managing costs is an iterative cycle that requires several key processes to be 
 completed. Feedback secured from each stage allows the enterprise to continually improve its efficiency and become 
 more confident about its predictions. (see 
 Figure 3.3
 ) 
  
 Workforce management systems should offer the following functionalities to support the modern customer-focused 
 enterprise:
  
 ●     
 Scheduling to meet service levels
  
 ●     
 Adherence
  
 ●     
 Reporting and forecasting
  
 ●     
 What-if scenarios
  
 ●     
 Virtual contact center/multisite support
  
 ●     
 Compliance with employment law, rules, and union regulations
  
 ●     
 Multimedia support",NA
Scheduling to meet service levels,"Scheduling is not as simple a process as it may appear. Knowledgeable organizations take CSR preferences and 
 skill sets into account when scheduling. The ""warm-body"" approach to solving human resource issues—regarding 
 one CSR the same as any other—will cause both agent-satisfaction and customer-service problems. Most companies 
 using advanced workforce management software will have between 6 and 9 skillsets to work with, although a few 
 contact centers use as many as 50. Business needs must come first, however, so a scheduler needs to find the best 
 way to match the company's requirements with the skills of its employees. Scheduling can get particularly 
 complicated in a multimedia environment, which usually has CSRs with multiple media-handling skills—voice, e-mail, 
 text chat, and so on—and multiple business abilities such as sales, service product knowledge, and languages. 
 Businesses must look for a solution that does not oversimplify the scheduling process, yet retains usability and the 
 flexibility to make changes.
  
 Prior to planning staffing resources, an organization needs to have an understanding of past history. A WFM system 
 that provides historical data from all customer contacts, based on input from CTI as well as the ACD, means that 
 scheduling can be more realistic. The WFM solution should enable organizations to factor in exceptions that affect 
 staff workload—advertising campaigns, training, public holidays, and other special events and occasions—and 
 determine the best time for a meeting or training session, as well as measure the impact on the overall operation of 
 the center. Thus, an important factor in assessing the capabilities of WFM tools is 
 flexibility in forecasting 
 functionality,
  because situations can develop very quickly that make forecasts useless without the ability to alter 
 schedules to reflect reality.",NA
Adherence,"Adherence is the ability to compare forecasts with reality and to use this information to correct problems. 
 Sophisticated scheduling and forecasting is useless without the opportunity to improve the process through 
 adherence monitoring. Real-time adherence allows managers to see exactly what is happening and can alert them to 
 deviations from the expected activity, allowing them to make changes before problems occur. Adherence allows a 
 business to fine-tune its call/contact center activity; the more it is used, the more accurate the forecasts and 
 schedules will be.
  
 The objective of call/contact center managers should be to look for a solution that is simple to understand so the staff 
 will feel comfortable using it and that has the power and functionality to help the center manager understand what has 
 happened and to make necessary changes quickly.",NA
Reporting and forecasting,"The ability of managers and supervisors to see exactly what is happening via real-time reports is key to the workforce 
 management process. Reporting provides a measure of success in achieving targets. Standard reports that are 
 important for determining efficiency include
  
 ●     
 Speed of answer
  
 ●     
 Average call-handling time
  
 ●     
 Talk plus Not-ready plus Non-ACD",NA
What-if scenarios ,"One of the most useful tools for call/contact center managers, particularly in a multimedia environment, is the ability 
 to see what will happen to service levels if an event occurs, before that event occurs. Sophisticated workforce 
 management systems allow managers to try out what-if scenarios, at no risk to the center's operational ability, by 
 providing a way to model various scenarios.
  
 Using these modeling techniques, the contact center manager can, for example, understand how the center 
 workload would change if the following events occurred:
  
  
 ●     
 A new advertising campaign increases call volumes.
  
 ●     
 A large number of untrained agents start work at the same time.
  
 ●     
 A new multimedia channel becomes available to customers.
  
 ●     
 A key product line is offered at a discount.
  
 What-if scenarios are very useful in directing long-term strategies, such as planning, budgeting, and recruitment.",NA
Virtual contact center/Multisite support ,"An increasing trend in some global enterprises, especially in larger markets such as the United States, the United 
 Kingdom, Germany, and France is to have several call/contact centers servicing customers. This operational model 
 has been driven by a number of developments, including
  
  
 ●     
 Rapid call/contact center growth in particular areas that has caused recruitment and retention problems
  
  
 ●     
 The increased number of call/contact centers for businesses involved in acquisitions or mergers
  
  
 ●     
 Teleworking and remote call center locations that mean CSRs may never see their parent center
  
  
 ●     
 The preference of some companies to offer a ""local touch"" to customers by basing centers in their area
  
  
 ●     
 Improvements in networking and telephony that make it easier to establish virtual centers
  
  
 ●     
 The increasing need of companies to serve global customers, requiring either operating contact centers in 
 different time zones or 
  
 paying overtime to CSRs to work covering hours
  
  
 ●     
 The possibilities of operational redundancy and disaster recovery with multisite centers 
  
 Combining multiple smaller centers into one large center can provide significant economic benefit through simple 
 economies of scale. 
  
 Correctly staffing five 100-seat call/contact centers is generally more complex and less efficient than staffing a single 
 500-seat operation. This is especially true when skills-based routing via a universal queue is being used. All agent",NA
"Compliance: union rules, regulations, and the law",file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0019.html (5 von 13) [20.09.2007 19:03:14],NA
Multimedia support,"Workforce management systems provide a significant benefit to call/ contact center managers by answering one of 
 the most urgent questions center managers ask themselves: 
 How do I staff my multimedia contact center
 ? Many 
 so-called contact centers simply give agents a few e-mails to deal with when call volumes decrease, but when call 
 volumes rise, e-mails are forgotten. Contact center managers may be quite capable of efficiently managing 
 telephony-only call centers. In many cases, their experience allows them to make good judgment calls on these 
 operational issues, based on years of experience. However, managing the multimedia contact center challenges 
 even the most seasoned call center manager, because multimedia contacts and transactions are fundamentally 
 different from telephone calls and must be handled differently. This is a situation that can lead to staffing issues, for 
 the following reasons:
  
 ●     
 CSR competencies have to be considered.
  Good telephony CSRs may not have the skills required to be good 
 at handling e-mail or text chat contacts, where quick typing speed is required along with strong technology skills 
 and correct spelling, grammar, and punctuation. CSRs good at written customer service may not have the 
 listening or verbal communication skills required for telephony service.
  
 ●     
 Customers have different levels of expectation depending on the channel they are using.
  Most customers 
 expect a response via e-mail within 24 hours, whereas a typical telephony service level is 80% of calls to be 
 answered within 20 seconds.
  
 ●     
 Standard responses using e-mail can speed up the process considerably.
  
 ●     
 Batch customer requests—e-mail, fax, and letter—are, by definition, not interactive.
  Additional resources may 
 be needed to deal with incomplete requests.
  
 ●     
 Telephone queues are essentially self-managing.
  If the phone is not answered quickly enough, the call is 
 abandoned and the phone queue decreases. With e-mail, contacts back up until they are dealt with, a situation that 
 can present serious problems.
  
 ●     
 E-mails may get ""stale-dated"" because the customer loses interest, gives up on the e-mail, and calls the center 
 for a verbal response.
  This leads to a nonproductive, time- and resource-wasting cycle of answering dead e-
 mails while live ones go unattended until they too go out-of-date!
  
 ●     
 Costs increase as the unsatisfied e-mail customer rings the contact center to find out what happened to the e-
 mail.
  Where e-mails are held separately from transactions—that is, in organizations where the universal queue 
 and universal routing are not being used—the e-mail may remain live even after the issue has been resolved.

 Universal routing and the universal queue.",NA
The major benefits of WFM,"The major benefits of WFM tools are
  
 ●     
 More efficient scheduling—managing changes in complex schedules and optimizing schedules
  
 ●     
 Significant cost savings through efficient staffing levels and use of equipment",NA
Other benefits of WFM,"There are a number of other less tangible, but nonetheless important, benefits of WFM that also need to be 
 considered when deciding to incorporate this tool into the call center, and at what level and cost. These benefits 
 include the following:",NA
Provision of threshold alert,"Supervisors have instant information about intrashift variations that could cascade through the day and cause 
 problems later. Schedules can be adjusted ""on the fly.""",NA
Reporting on performance evaluation,"Workforce management systems are not the only means of collecting performance data, but can be a means for 
 making all the data coming from the ACD most relevant and meaningful. Coordinating the real-time and historical 
 (short-term) views of activity is better than spreading that information and its analysis among different software tools, 
 which creates islands of information that are harder to put back together later.",NA
Discovering why service levels are not being met,"WFM can provide information related to questions such as was an entire group's abandon rate higher because 
 someone took lunch a little too early or because there were too few CSRs on hand for an expected spike? Or were 
 there too many CSRs with a perfect service level at an unacceptably high cost? What would happen if 10 people 
 were added to that shift? It can minimize unnecessary overtime payments, and provide calculations to justify making 
 more CSRs available.",NA
Coordinating among multiple sites,"Integrating call center sites by pulling together agents from multiple sites into one virtual center provides all the 
 workforce efficiencies obtainable with a single center with greater economies of scale.",NA
Empowering CSRs by providing information,"Schedules can be worked out to allow CSRs to understand the hows and whys of the decision-making process. 
 Accurate call volume predictions and an automated scheduler that optimizes break and time-off preferences 
 fairly lead to fewer complaints.",NA
Simulating conditions and changes,"Workforce management systems, when combined with simulation software, take existing or historical conditions 
 and allow managers to adjust the parameters to conduct what-if scenarios. They can determine the effects of 
 adding or subtracting people, changing group dynamics, and adding different technologies to the front end.",NA
Providing competitive advantages in the workforce environment,"The power to react to changing circumstances is a significant competitive advantage. Having a handle on costs, call 
 volumes, and other variables in the call center operation mix can be a valuable aid to call center management. As 
 well, it will ensure a better-managed, more-informed, happier workforce, making the call center more attractive as 
 an employer, particularly in regions where skilled workers are hard to get and keep.
  
 Currently, the penetration of the WFM tool in the call center workplace is so low that simply installing the software 
 automatically confers a technology advantage over the competition. Although WFM tools may not be as fancy a 
 technology tool as Web/call center technology combinations or VoIP agents, they work well, have been proven 
 over time, and can reduce costs and aggravation.
  
 A Two-Step Reference Guide for Using WFM
  
 ●     
 Simulate conditions:
  Use the software to create scenarios, for example, having two CSRs on vacation 
 simultaneously, adding a part-time CSR for a few hours on Mondays, increasing call volume. Using 
 software to simulate what-if scenarios lets you know how abandoned calls will increase and how long 
 callers will be likely to wait in queue. 
 Simulation will demonstrate the effects of changes.",NA
Rationale for implementing WFM,"In many companies, workforce management systems are not considered to be an essential element of call/contact 
 center management resources in the initial setup of the center, despite the compelling rationale for installing these 
 systems. When the pressure to cope effectively with the growth of customer interactions builds on the center, 
 business users and operational staff must make a decision about which variety of WFM system is required.
  
 Analysis of the cost and benefits of WFM systems indicates that the average time to breakeven on initial 
 expenditures for workforce management solutions is 12 months using traditional workforce management systems 
 in a telephony-based call center. Workforce management systems in multimedia contact centers will reduce the 
 time to breakeven by about 50%, meaning that it will usually take six months from initial implementation, rather 
 than 12 months.
  
 The intangible returns must also be considered, because the call/contact center is an environment that can thrive or 
 not depending on how well intangible aspects are managed. Happy, satisfied employees, reductions in recruitment 
 and training costs through lower agent attrition, and increased upselling because of increased customer satisfaction 
 are examples of intangibles that are important to the organization and that need to be considered by call/contact 
 center management.",NA
Review of functionality and benefits of WFM tools,"Here is a summary checklist of features and functionality previously described that organizations evaluating 
 workforce management systems need to consider. The WFM system should support the following features:
  
 Forecasting
  
 A core component of any WFM should take account of past operational data and be capable of assisting managers to 
 plan exceptions.
  
 Scheduling
  
 Resourcing and supporting a skills-based environment is a critical function, and CRM-focused organizations have to 
 take into account agent preferences and abilities.
  
 Adherence
  
 Key characteristics of effective WFM tools enable managers to see quickly whether activities are going as 
 planned, and if not, to change them before it is too late.
  
 Web-driven flexibility
  
 Where remote working and ""hot-desking"" occur in a center operation, browser-based access via an intranet is a 
 useful feature.
  
 Reporting
  
 Real-time reports are critical to the effectiveness of center operations, and flexibility and rapid report capabilities 
 should be considered.
  
 What-if scenario planning
  
 Where major changes are anticipated—adding many new agents, channels, or advertising and marketing 
 campaigns—what-if scenario functionality means testing the waters before embarking on a full-scale campaign.
  
 Multimedia support",NA
Available WFM systems,"This section reviews the general characteristics of vendor offerings in workforce management tools, in particular, 
 monitoring systems. A listing of specific vendors and the products they offer is contained in 
 Appendix A
 , ""Call 
 Center Vendor Resources—Product and Service 
  
 Offerings."" This very robust and advanced area of technology offers a variety of products to serve different call center 
 characteristics. A major contributor to advances in this area is the growth of the Internet, a technology that has made 
 it easier to store and retrieve information across networks and in a variety of different media formats.",NA
Monitoring systems,"Monitoring is a critical part of the process of teaching a new CSR how to deal with customers, how to handle difficult 
 situations, and simply how to follow a script and read a screen full of complex information. Feedback is important to 
 improving the performance of CSRs. Even CSRs that have years of experience need constant skill assessment and 
 additional training to update their phone skills and to keep them up-to-date on new technologies and how to use 
 them.
  
 Some telephone switches have a monitoring system built in, and some vendors provide sophisticated software for 
 combined monitoring and quality assurance programs. Typically, these software tools collect data about agent 
 performance and assess that data over the short or long term. Some products also automate the scheduling of agent 
 monitoring for later review. Managers don't need to be present to monitor or to set up tapes.
  
 Training headset models are also available that have a second jack on the amplifier to accommodate a ""no-
 microphone"" headset that a trainer could wear when sitting beside the trainee. A low-budget monitoring system can 
 be incorporated by plugging a tape recorder into the jack.",NA
Pros and cons of monitoring systems,"There are two basic criteria for quality measurement in call centers:
  
 ●     
 Ensuring the center has the best CSRs available, operating at the highest level they can personally achieve
  
 ●     
 Enforcing a consistent standard of quality for customer contacts from the customer's point of view
  
 Monitoring CSRs is still the best way to achieve quality in terms of both criteria. If handled with sensitivity, monitoring 
 can be a benefit to CSRs because it helps them define and reach career goals, assess strengths and weaknesses, 
 and make progress according to realistic standards. One technique used by some organizations is to involve senior 
 management in the call center process. A call is monitored by a senior executive so that this individual hears directly 
 the ""voice of the customer."" Although monitoring does have some negative implications, if properly presented to 
 CSRs the benefits to both the individual and the center become obvious. The proper instructions for using monitoring 
 products emphasize the benefits to both parties of performance monitoring.
  
 One obvious benefit of monitoring, assuming that it is performed in the right atmosphere, is that it creates an 
 objective standard of behavior that can be measured and one that can be repeated. It helps ensure delivery not only 
 of good service but also of consistent service from each and every CSR. From a CSR's viewpoint, monitoring 
 creates a way to measure performance that can be described in advance and critiqued intelligently. Results can be 
 quantified and reps can see improvement over time. As well, it allows management to benchmark standards and 
 ensure that all CSRs are treated fairly and by the same standards.",NA
Excesses in monitoring,"Some monitoring tools go too far in assessing CSR performance and can be a detriment to improving productivity. As 
 noted previously, call centers typically have the problem of high turnover; one product that has a voice analyzer that 
 dynamically analyzes the speech flow of either the CSR or the customer during a call would probably make this 
 problem worse. The product advises supervisors about how CSRs are ""feeling"" during the call by reporting on stress",NA
"Selecting, installing, and using monitoring systems","Several useful guidelines, discussed in the 
 next section
 , for monitoring systems should be considered before 
 selecting a system and 
  
 installing it in a new or existing call center operation. The newest technology tools are broad-based and make it 
 possible for call center supervisors and managers to combine streams, allowing performance trends for both 
 individual CSRs and groups to be analyzed from a variety of perspectives. Such an analysis can be scaled up to 
 look at an entire center or groups of centers. Add information from accounts receivable, order entry, and other 
 areas and a picture emerges that describes several characteristics about CSR performance. Thus, information on 
 how much money a CSR or group of CSRs generates and whether a particular campaign is in trouble can be 
 accessed.",NA
Important guidelines for using quality monitoring systems,Here are three key pointers based on the experience of call center managers who have installed monitoring systems:,NA
Select current recording and conversion technology,"Two improvements in recording technology have occurred in the last decade. First, digital recording replaced 
 analog, making it easier to store and retrieve specific calls; second, CTI links have made it possible to convert 
 digital recording into data and combine it with other information about transactions.",NA
Select software that works in tandem with core recording systems,"Software products are available to help solve the problem of accessing disparate information throughout the 
 enterprise by serving as a central repository for information from many sources, such as workforce management, 
 human resources, predictive dialers, and ACDs. Combining, assessing, and exploring information from multiple 
 sources is critical as call centers evolve into customer contact centers, because no one source has sufficient 
 information to provide a complete performance picture.",NA
Select an appropriate monitoring frequency,"A CSR should be monitored for quality as frequently as is dictated by criteria such as how long that CSR has 
 been on staff, what kind of traffic the CSR handles (inbound or outbound, sales or service), the sensitivity of the 
 kind of customer interaction (i.e., financial services would monitor at a higher rate than telemarketing, etc.), as 
 well as what kind of technology is used to do the monitoring.",NA
Measuring results,"In a Spring of 2002 survey of call centers, 
 Call Center Monitoring Study II Final Report,
  a majority of call centers 
 (93%) reported monitoring CSR calls, reflecting a 5% increase in the number of centers conducting monitoring two 
 years earlier. According to this study, conducted by Incoming Calls Management Institute and A. C. Nielsen Co. of",NA
Web-driven interfaces and tools,"In today's call/contact center environment, managers and CSRs are not always in one central location. The existence 
 of virtual multisite centers, teleworking, or dispersed call/contact center operations does not mean that workforce 
 management systems cannot be employed. Businesses should look for a workforce management system that can be 
 operated by remote users, if required. One approach is a browser-based application linked to the organization's 
 intranet or the Internet, allowing scheduling, reporting, and management from any PC at any location with 
 communication resources. In this configuration, CSRs also have the ability to access schedules, enter preferences, 
 and request vacation time seamlessly and remotely.
  
 Browser-based publishing tools also make collecting and sharing customer data within the call center and throughout 
 the enterprise as easy as accessing a Web page. Call centers can publish customer contact information in a browser 
 page format or ""Web desktop,"" thus simplifying the transfer of customer information from the call center to the 
 enterprise.
  
 Departments outside of the call center can use these systems to get customized access to data necessary to make 
 more strategic and timely business decisions. Data that can be accessed include digital call recordings and call 
 center performance reports. Executive management, marketing, and product development, for instance, can track 
 customer response to promotions, monitor service quality, and query customers through this system. Products such 
 as these are part of an enterprise call center suite, an automated call monitoring system that collects and publishes 
 information about customer contact with a company's CSRs.
  
 Core elements of these Web tools include call evaluations and graphical comparisons of individual versus group 
 performance. Supervisors can also add training tools, provide productivity reports, publish department-specific 
 issues, and highlight morale programs, such as ""CSR of the month,"" incentives, and other events.",NA
Monitoring: summing up,"The more automation, in theory, the less human monitoring is required because there is a better opportunity to 
 obtain a true, random representative sample. If CSRs are convinced that monitoring is truly random, then their 
 behavior smoothes out and they are less likely to vary their responses between calls. The controversy over 
 monitoring—how often, what tools, and how to address the issue with CSRs—is ongoing. Monitoring is essentially 
 about judging people and their performance. Technology alone cannot make the monitoring process a success. 
 Informed judgments need to be made by supervisors and managers, who must supply humanity to the application 
 of technology tools.",NA
3.3 Twelve characteristics of the best-managed call centers,"Some call centers exude energy that may take one or more different forms: a feeling of community, pride of 
 workmanship, and results that spring from good planning and coordination. Everyone in the center knows what the 
 mission is and is focused on attaining the objectives. They are all pulling in the same direction, just like a well-trained 
 sports team. A number of benchmarking studies address the subject of what makes a well-managed call center. But 
 while these surveys report on the results obtained by these centers in terms of customer satisfaction and retention, 
 service levels, planning accuracy, organizational structure, costs and revenues, employee satisfaction and turnover, 
 they seldom describe 
 how
  positive results were obtained.
  
 The following 12 characteristics have been compiled from the experience of industry analysts and call center 
 managers and represent a summary of those qualities that contribute to a well-managed call center. They are the 
 attributes of some of the world's best-managed call centers, those that consistently outperform others in their 
 respective industries based on commonly accepted measurement criteria, including customer surveys.",NA
Recognize people as the key to success,"Call centers that recognize the direction in which the business is going are continually cultivating CSR skills. They 
 provide training and present attractive career paths to their people. They also consider the whole person when hiring 
 and when rewarding for good performance. They pay attention to people's inherent talents and abilities, not just the 
 job categories and specific duties.
  
 Leading call centers also develop formal and informal communication channels in their organizations. Keeping 
 people well informed helps them prepare for and accept change. Change is personal, and its meaning and level of 
 acceptance are based clearly on how change is communicated and how it is perceived.",NA
Receive support from the corporate culture,"Corporate culture, often referred to as ""the value principles"" of an organization, tends to guide employee behavior 
 and can either support and enhance the best-laid plans for organizational change or ruin them. There is no magic 
 formula for creating a supportive corporate culture; however, managers in well-run call centers agree that shaping the 
 culture of the organization is a primary leadership responsibility. They do not believe that this process should be left 
 to fate, and they therefore devote considerable effort to understanding their organization and the people who are part 
 of it.
  
 Effective communication is a primary ingredient of a high-performance culture, creating meaning and direction for 
 people. Organizations of all types depend on the existence of shared meanings and interpretations of reality, which 
 facilitate coordinated action among employees. Many management training programs fail to appreciate the 
 complexity and paradoxical nature of human organizations. Unfortunately, thought processes that should be involved 
 in management principles give way to how-to-do-it formulas and techniques and slogans and homilies as the principle 
 management guidelines. The most effective call center managers are comfortable with the fact that it is seldom 
 possible to completely master interpersonal relationships and that compromises are necessary. Understanding this 
 reality of life means spending more time on ""people issues"" than on anything else.",NA
Focus quality on customer expectations,"The best-managed call centers have a strong focus on evolving customer needs and expectations, and they are 
 continually redefining quality around those expectations. They appreciate the fact that what worked yesterday may 
 not necessarily work tomorrow.",NA
Establish a collaborative planning process,"A major objective of good call center planning is to ""get the right number of people in the right places at the right 
 time."" Systematic planning accomplishes other positive objectives, however, including contributing to effective 
 communication and creating a body of information that wouldn't otherwise be available. Call load patterns support the 
 structure of schedules. Planning is the catalyst that encourages people to think about the future and see their 
 contributions to the overall picture. Systematic planning is also important because it requires communication on 
 issues such as resource allocation, budgeting, and workload priorities. Constant communication about these activities 
 is a requirement for all active call centers.",NA
Consider the incoming call center a total process,file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0020.html (1 von 5) [20.09.2007 19:03:15],NA
Establish an effective mix of technology and people,"In the call center environment, personal contact with callers has to be reduced because there is simply too much 
 caller demand for CSRs to handle routine calls or tasks that technology can readily handle. However, it is an 
 important and fundamental aspect of good customer relations that callers are not relegated to machine responses 
 when they need a real live person or when they prefer live answers to product or service questions.
  
 Leading call centers continue to work to find the right mix of people and technology. Although technology can take an 
 organization where it's going, very quickly, it's a good idea to be headed in the right direction! This means recognizing 
 both where technology fits and the importance of the human element in making technology work effectively.
  
 As noted in 
 Chapter 2
 , new technologies are not passive; they are continually changing caller expectations, causing 
 reallocations of 
  
 resources, power shifts in call centers, and changes in the responsibilities of CSRs and managers. The 
 challenge for call center professionals is to sort through the many choices, identify the technologies that can 
 further the mission of the organization, and then implement them with the necessary foresight and planning.",NA
Provide the correct mix of specialization and pooling,"Pooling resources is one of the key characteristics of the incoming call center industry and is a primary function of 
 technology tools such as ACDs, networks, and other supporting devices and systems. The advanced capabilities and 
 increasing sophistication of intelligent ACDs and network services provide call centers with the means to mix and 
 match the incoming call load in a variety of ways. The pooling activity that takes place in call centers that have the 
 latest technology represents a continually changing mix of specialization and pooling. The technology available to 
 handle each call according to its individual needs and characteristics requires call center planning, operation, and 
 management to remain focused on cross training and broadening the skills of reps. There will be overlap, however, 
 and contingencies in the operation that must be managed with intelligence and rationality. Leading call centers have 
 an edge over other, less-productive call center environments because they have been able to strike the right mix of 
 specialization and pooling—one of the reasons they obtain high marks for their successful operations. To accomplish 
 this objective, they do the following:
  
 ●     
 Expand responsibilities for CSRs
  
 ●     
 Avoid unnecessary complexity in CSR group structures
  
 ●     
 Improve information systems and training so that CSRs are capable of handling a broad range of transactions
  
 ●     
 Implement a flowchart system and network programming to identify weaknesses in routing logic",NA
Leverage key statistics ,"The indicators of high-level call center performance include
  
  
 ●     
 Average call value (for revenue-producing call centers)
  
  
 ●     
 Successful forecasts of call load versus actual load
  
  
 ●     
 Service level
  
  
 ●     
 Cost per call
  
  
 ●     
 Customer satisfaction
  
  
 ●     
 Adherence to schedule
  
  
 ●     
 Percentage of abandoned calls
  
  
 ●     
 Errors and rework required
  
  
 ●     
 Average call-handling time 
  
 Related to these operating statistics are three common characteristics of call centers that 
 get the best results:
  
 ●     
 They ensure statistical measurements are accurate, complete, and 
 as unbiased as possible.
  
 ●     
 Reports are viewed in relation to each other.
  
 ●     
 They are aware that simply tracking high-level measurements won't inherently improve results.
  
 They know that a single report, outside the context of the others, can lead to erroneous conclusions and that 
 statistics can often be misleading. They prefer to work on the root causes of problem areas.",NA
Receive budgets and support as needed ,"Often in call center operations, the budget is presented to call center managers before objectives have been stated 
 and before anyone has agreed that objectives could be met within the assigned budget. It is much more logical for 
 the ""budgetsetters"" in an organization to ask the individuals responsible for meeting defined objectives how much 
 money they need, what other resources, and so on. A good analogy is the airline industry: Airlines couldn't possibly 
 operate flights without a tangible connection between the results they want to achieve and the supporting resources. 
 They start with an objective to fly a certain number of people to a particular destination and then budget to do this. 
 The goal is a specific, predetermined outcome supported by carefully calculated resources. This is the way senior 
 corporate management should consider call center operations—
 specific objectives that require a certain level of 
 resources.
  The best call center managers decide on their objectives first and then obtain the necessary resources to 
 support those objectives through careful planning.",NA
"Hurdle distance, time, and politics effectively ","The evolution of computer and telecommunications technologies has resulted in the birth of new companies and the 
 growth of existing companies that can span both geography and time. Fiber-optic cables crisscross the globe, and 
 satellites provide virtually worldwide telecommunications service. Trends in the call center industry reflect these 
 developments in the global marketplace. Distributed call centers, in which two or more centers share the call load, 
 can span a region, a country, or the globe and are becoming commonplace. Telecommuting programs continue to 
 proliferate at a growing rate. Call center personnel have been formed into cross-functional teams, with responsibilities 
 for everything from forecasting the workload to improving quality.",NA
Be prepared and willing to experiment,"Reassessing and reviewing operating procedures to determine how well the center is doing compared to its 
 objectives is another hallmark of the most successful call centers. These reviews attempt to answer such questions 
 as What areas can be improved? What activities can be terminated? What assumptions no longer make sense? 
 What can be done differently? Is there an opportunity for outsourcing some call center activities?",NA
Be capable of vision,"The call center industry has come a long way in recent years. Customer expectations are high and call centers are 
 gradually learning how to meet them. Most of the best-managed incoming call centers have learned how to deliver 
 value to their organizations and its customers. Collectively, these organizations have invested billions of dollars and 
 considerable time and effort in equipment, networks, and software, as well as in human resources, including many 
 hours spent training and equipping call center staff to meet their responsibilities. Centers are now fully versed in the 
 nuances of forecasting, staffing, and the behavior of queues. They have identified evolving customer needs, are 
 constantly changing and improving processes to meet those needs, and finding new and better ways of operating in 
 an increasingly competitive business environment.
  
 Summing up the overall characteristics of well-managed call centers demonstrates that the best-managed centers 
 are those that have excellent resource planning and management processes that are systematic, collaborative, and 
 accurate and that result in the productivity, service level, and quality that make them industry leaders.",NA
The future of call center management,"Some call center mangers may view the future with some trepidation and may have reservations about the impact of 
 the next wave of technology, but the future can bring many benefits. The growth of e-commerce and the changes it 
 will require in traditional call center operations and processes will certainly have a significant effect on how call 
 centers operate, as will the changing business environment. Call centers will therefore be required to handle an 
 increasingly diverse mix of transactions. Managers wonder about how to keep up in an environment that is moving at",NA
3.4 The incoming call center,"Incoming Calls Management Institute has developed a working definition of incoming call center management that 
 is used in this book and was first stated in 
 Chapter 3
 :
  
 Incoming call center management is the art of having the right number of skilled people and 
 supporting resources in place at the right times to handle an accurately forecasted workload, at a 
 specified service level and with quality.
  
 This definition leads to two major objectives for incoming call centers:
  
 ●     
 Locate the right resources in the right places at the right times
  
 ●     
 Provide a service level with quality
  
 The capability of call centers to meet these objectives has evolved through three definable major stages:
  
 1.  
 Service level awareness
 —maintaining service level as calls arrive, with some correlation to service level in 
 planning
  
 2.  
 Seat-of-the pants management
 —little consideration of service level in planning
  
 3.  
 Correlating service level to the organization's mission
 —choosing an appropriate service level and tying 
 resources to 
  
 achieving this service level",NA
An eight-stage process for systematic planning and management,"Many individual organizations have evolved through the same general stages and most now link service level to 
 quality and the overall mission. Systematic planning and management are required to accomplish this important 
 linkage and can be accomplished through an eight-stage process:
  
 1.  
 Select a Service Level Objective
  Service level is defined as a certain percentage of calls answered in a 
 specified time frame, measured in seconds. The level should be appropriate for the services being provided 
 and the expectations of callers using those services. Service level is the critical link between resources and 
 results.
  
 2.  
 Collect Data
  ACD and computer systems are important sources of planning data because they provide call 
 statistics and details such as number of incoming calls, duration of calls, call patterns, and changes in the call 
 mix. Information about what marketing and other departments are doing, changes in legislation, competitor 
 activities, and changes in customer needs and perceptions is also required.
  
 3.  
 Forecast Call Load
  Call load includes three components: call volume, average talk time, and average after-
 call work. A good forecast predicts all three components accurately for future time periods, usually in half-
 hour segments. In the modern call center, forecasting must go beyond inbound calls to reflect other choices 
 customers have to interact with organizations—e-mail, faxes, and video and Web-based transactions.
  
 4.  
 Determine the Base Staff Requirement
  A formula commonly used for calculating staffing requirements is 
 Erlang C. This formula (to be described later in this chapter) is used in virtually all workforce management 
 software systems and by many call center managers. Computer simulation programs also may provide 
 solutions for staffing and a number of other management issues. 
  
 New capabilities, such as skill-based routing and complex network environments, must also be taken into 
 account when planning staffing.
  
 5.  
 Calculate Trunks and Related Systems Resources
  Staffing and trunking issues are inextricably 
 associated and must 
  
 be calculated together.
  
 6.  
 Calculate Rostered Staff Factor and Organize Schedules
  Rostered staff factor, also referred to as 
 shrink 
 factor
  or 
 shrinkage,
  adds realism to staffing requirements by accounting for breaks, absenteeism, training, and 
 nonphone work. Schedules are essentially forecasts of who needs to be where and when. They should lead to 
 getting the right people in the right places at the right times.",NA
New opportunities and new challenges,"In the marketing environment of the 21st century, there are enormous opportunities for interacting with customers. 
 New services built around the World Wide Web, video capabilities, and other multimedia technologies are bringing 
 new opportunities and challenges to the call center. 
  
 Many inbound call center managers and CSRs are concerned about the new technologies and how they will affect 
 their jobs and the call center industry in general.
  
 The changing environment has caused the term 
 incoming call center
  to be challenged on several fronts even as call 
 centers are being accepted as an integral element of the business environment. The controversy is over the 
 definition of this entity: Is it a center that handles calls? This concept hardly describes the incoming call center of 
 today, of which there are hundreds in a variety of business sectors, from financial institutions to communications 
 companies (see 
 chapter 5
 , ""Call Center Case Studies""). 
 Calls
  are just one type of customer 
  
 communication, and the word 
 center
  does not describe the many multisite environments nor the growing number of 
 organizations that have telecommuting programs. 
 Call center
  has become an umbrella term for a variety of customer 
 contact facilities, including reservation centers, help desks, information lines, and customer service centers, 
 regardless of how they are organized or what types of transactions they handle.
  
 Call center planning and management has also changed, not fundamentally, but in ways that are related to the new 
 environment and the new technologies. With integrated Web services, customers and potential customers browsing a 
 Website can click a button, be connected to the call center, and receive immediate live assistance. Planning and 
 managing in this environment should involve the steps in the eight-stage planning and managing process described 
 in the 
 previous section
 . Planning for and managing video calls is another example. The process 
  
 begins by choosing an appropriate service level objective, then collecting data, forecasting the video call load, 
 calculating the base level of agents required, planning for system resources, and so on. The objectives are the 
 same as for a more traditional call center operation: the right number of video-equipped agents and necessary 
 technology resources in the right places at the right times, performing the right functions.",NA
Changes to come,"Changes in call center management practices related to the new types of transactions that need to be handled will 
 be required. The new transactions will become increasingly complex as technology automates simple and routine 
 tasks and leaves CSRs to manage interactions requiring the human touch. Customer expectations will continue to 
 climb, and callers will not tolerate organizations that do not provide the choices and service levels they demand. 
 The personal skills required of call center personnel, however, will not change: CSRs will still need good writing and 
 customer service skills. Finding the right mix of technology and human capital will require an ongoing effort.
  
 Since the early 1900s, there have been many advances in technology and the art and science of communication has 
 been in the forefront, as described in 
 Chapter 2
 . Technology has had significant impact on the call center: Operators, 
 for example, are no longer needed to connect 
  
 calls because the process has been automated. But managing the modern call center faces challenges similar to 
 those faced by the telephone pioneers. Forecasting calls accurately, staffing appropriately, and getting the right 
 people and other resources in the right places at the right times are continuing problems that connect today's call 
 center to the past, as noted at the beginning of this chapter.
  
 As telephone services matured, several solutions to resource management challenges were proposed. One of the 
 first individuals to solve the problem of handling vast numbers of incoming calls and arriving at the optimum level of 
 operator resources was A. K. Erlang. Erlang's queuing formula, 
 Erlang C,
  still widely used today, gradually evolved 
 into a programming language (Erlang) that has been used in a variety of mission-critical areas, especially in 
 applications that must run continuously and across many machines such as air traffic control and, of course, call 
 center operations.",NA
3.5 Call centers—corporate business hubs,"Recent studies indicate that in many sectors of the economy call centers have become a major factor in customer 
 retention, competitiveness, and ability to adapt to changing markets. These operations are the ""front wall"" of the 
 organization—often the first contact point for a customer. Senior executives are becoming much more aware of the 
 significant contributions an efficient, customer-oriented call center can make to corporate business objectives and are 
 supporting initiatives to attract the best people possible to their call centers. As call centers play an ever-increasing 
 role in regional, national, and international economies, governments at all levels are providing tax incentives for call 
 centers to locate in their jurisdictions.",NA
Call center managers—professional skills,"Those who aspire to call center management positions will need to develop a definable skillset to achieve success. 
 These skills include
  
 ●     
 Communication
 —writing, speaking, and interpersonal communication with all levels of management
  
 ●     
 Project management
 —the ability to manage several projects at the same time
  
 ●     
 Training
 —understanding the importance of training and the various training methodologies available
  
 ●     
 Leadership and management
 —the ability to develop trust in employees and manage call center activities
  
 ●     
 Performance assessments
 —the ability to review and assess employee performance
  
 ●     
 Quantitative analysis
 —the ability to analyze statistical reports
  
 Call center managers who successfully meet these challenges have significant opportunities for advancement. As 
 noted previously, call center management has become a recognized management position and has cross-industry 
 applications and thus the same job mobility opportunities as other industry management positions.",NA
Knowledge requirements,"In addition to a skillset, there are some other attributes which might be called 
 knowledge requirements.

3.6 Service level—a core value,"At the heart of effective incoming call center management is the principle of 
 service level.
  A service level objective 
 can be used to determine the resources required and the effectiveness of the center in its impact on the corporate 
 business goals. Here are some of the questions that can be answered by establishing and monitoring a specified 
 level of service:
  
 ●     
 How accessible is the call center?
  
 ●     
 How much staff is required?
  
 ●     
 How does the center compare to the competition?
  
 ●     
 Can the center handle the response to marketing campaigns?
  
 ●     
 How busy will the CSRs be?
  
 ●     
 What will the costs be?",NA
Defining a service level,"Service level is often referred to by various terms. In some call centers, it is the 
 telephone service factor,
  or TSF. 
 Others refer to it as 
 grade of service
  (GOS), although this may be confused with the term for the degree of blocking 
 on a group of trunks. Service level is also referred to as 
 accessibility
  or 
 service standard.
  Typically, the term 
 service 
 level
  is used to refer specifically to transactions that must be handled on arrival at the call center. Response time, 
 often called 
 speed of reply,
  may even be called 
 service level
  as well. To avoid confusion, response time will be used 
 in a specific sense in this book, to describe 
 the level of service assigned to transactions that can be handled at a later 
 time and do not need to be handled ""on arrival. ""
  
 The most widely-accepted definition of service level is based on the percentage of calls answered in a given time 
 frame, for example, 90 percent of calls answered in 20 seconds. Some managers define service level as a 
 percentage only or as an abandonment rate. Others refer to the percentage of the time the service level objective is 
 met, whatever that objective may be. And there are those who define service level as ""average speed of answer"" or 
 longest delayed call.
  
 The various interpretations and other definitions of service level often lead to misunderstandings and 
 mismanagement. By its nature, service level should be defined as a specific percentage of all calls answered in a 
 specific time frame, as previously noted. Planning should be based on achieving this target. Choosing an appropriate 
 service level objective is one of the first steps a call center manager should take to ensure effective planning and 
 management of the operation and to establish budgets.
  
 Establishing a service level helps to link resources to results and measures the degree to which customers are 
 being transferred and handled by a CSR. Service level is a tested and proven criterion in call centers worldwide for 
 transactions that must be handled when they arrive—most commonly inbound phone calls. However, as customer 
 contact methods change, new multimedia services—video calls and calls integrated with the World Wide Web—
 may also become part of the service level criterion. Because of its universal acceptance as a primary call center 
 criterion, service level will remain an important objective to the next generation of call centers.",NA
Other response categories,"In addition to the ""immediate response"" category, most incoming call centers are required to handle transactions 
 that belong in a second category, those that don't have to be handled at the time they arrive. Some examples of 
 these transactions are
  
 ●     
 Postal correspondence (snail mail)
  
 ●     
 E-mail
  
 ●     
 Faxes
  
 ●     
 Voice mail",NA
Other response criteria,"Average speed of answer (ASA), another often-used response criterion, is related to service level because it is 
 derived from the same set of data. However, ASA is often misinterpreted. In any set of data, it is generally assumed 
 that the average lies somewhere in the middle or that ""average"" represents typical experience. This is not true for call 
 center purposes. Although mathematically correct, the average does not represent the experience of individual 
 callers. In a call center, most callers get connected to a CSR 
 much quicker
  than the average, but some wait 
 far 
 beyond
  the average. For example, with an average speed of answer of 15 seconds, about 70 percent of callers get 
 answered immediately, but a small percentage of callers will wait three or four minutes in the calling queue. Although 
 ASA is useful in calculating some call center requirements—for example, in calculating trunk load—service level is a 
 more reliable and more telling measure of a caller's experience.",NA
Abandoned calls,"Considering call abandonment rates alone as a measure of whether staffing levels are appropriate can be quite 
 misleading. A high abandonment rate is probably a symptom of staff problems. But a low abandonment rate doesn't 
 necessarily mean the center is optimally staffed. If abandonment rates are unacceptable, call center managers need 
 to evaluate the situation to determine what is wrong. It is most likely that the evaluation will reveal a too low service 
 level. When service level is being achieved, abandonment rates tend to take care of themselves.",NA
Unanswered calls,"One important consideration about service level is what happens to calls that don't get answered in the specified 
 service-level time frame? Most Erlang C and computer simulation software programs can calculate the answers to 
 this question and others. For example, for a service level of 80 percent answered in 20 seconds, experience indicates 
 that about 30 percent of callers end up in the queue, that the longest wait will be around three minutes, and that the 
 average speed of answer will range from 10 to 15 seconds. This example points up the obvious fact that different 
 callers have different experiences with call centers, even if they are part of the same set of data measured by service 
 level, ASA, and other measurements. The reason for this is ""random call arrival,"" a reality of call center operation and 
 a factor that needs to be considered when deciding how to measure quality of service. Service level is the single best 
 measure of quality, largely because it enables the center to determine what happens to different callers.",NA
Inbound transactions—priority levels,"There are two major categories of inbound transactions, with two priority levels, that a call center needs to handle:
  
 ●     
 Those that must be handled when they arrive (e.g., inbound calls)—
 Performance objective: Service Level
  
 ●     
 Those than can be handled at a later time (e.g., correspondence)—
 Performance objective: Response Time",NA
The rationale for a service level,"Establishing a service level based on calls answered in a specified time as opposed to percentage of calls answered 
 or percentage of calls abandoned or even average speed of answer provides a clear-cut indication of a caller's 
 experience when contacting the call center. Service level is the most stable measurement of the inbound call-in 
 queue. The importance of a defined service level can be summed up by examining the effect on customers and call 
 center operations as it relates to the following factors:
  
 ●     
 Agent burnout and errors
  
 ●     
 Levels of lost calls
  
 ●     
 Customer goodwill
  
 ●     
 Links between resources and results",NA
Applying service-level metrics,"It is important that service level be interpreted in the context of call blockage, that is, calls not getting through. Any 
 time some portion of callers is getting busy signals, no matter whether generated by the system resulting from a 
 limited number of staff and lines during a busy period, service level reports only report on the calls that are getting 
 through. Reports based on service level and average speed of answer can be configured to look very impressive 
 simply by limiting the number of calls allowed to get through.
  
 Service level is obviously a time-dependent parameter, and daily service level reports may often conceal important 
 information. Service level may be down in the morning; however, if staff levels improve and every call in the afternoon 
 is handled immediately, the daily report will look very good against service-level objectives. On the other hand, the 
 level of service from a callers' perspective is a different story. It is not difficult for managers accountable for daily 
 reports and meeting service-level objectives to ""fudge"" these reports or call center activity to make the situation look 
 better than it really is. If the morning service level was low, they may keep CSRs on the phones through the afternoon 
 when the call load drops, just to make reports look better. This is a waste of valuable time and resources and 
 provides inconsistent service to customers.
  
 Consider this: If daily reports are potentially misleading, the longer the time frame between reports, the more 
 misleading they can be. Therefore, monthly averages for service level are virtually meaningless, because they 
 don't reflect the day-by-day, half-hour-by-half-hour realities. Even so, monthly reports are a popular way to 
 summarize activity for senior management, although there are more meaningful methods of reporting call center 
 activity.",NA
ACDs and service level,"There are a number of alternative methods to calculate service level using ACDs. Following are some of the 
 most common calculations used, although some ACDs allow users to specify other definitions of service level 
 using a variety of other call center parameters:
  
 1.  
 Calls answered in
  Y 
 seconds divided by calls answered:
  
  
 This is a very simple but incomplete measure of service level. It is not recommended for a definitive analysis 
 because it considers only answered calls. It is an incomplete recognition of call activity and, therefore, not a 
 good measure of service level. For example, call abandonment is entirely ignored in this calculation.
  
 2.  
 Calls answered + calls abandoned in
  Y 
 seconds divided by (total calls answered
  + 
 total calls abandoned):
  
  
 For most situations, this alternative is preferable because the calculations include all traffic received by the ACD; 
 therefore, it provides a complete picture of call center activity. The combination of total calls answered (TCA) 
 plus total calls abandoned (TCB) is often referred to as 
 total calls offered.
  
 3.  
 Calls answered in
  Y 
 seconds divided by the sum of (calls answered + calls abandoned):
  
  
 This alternative tends to be the least popular among call center managers because calls that enter the queue 
 but then fall into the abandoned category drive service level down. It is appropriate in situations where calls 
 enter a queue 
 after
  callers receive a delay announcement. It is not recommended in situations where callers 
 enter a queue 
 before
  they receive the delay announcement.
  
 4.  
 Calls answered before
  Y 
 seconds divided by (calls answered + calls abandoned) after
  Y 
 seconds:",NA
Turning service level into quality of service,"As many call center managers have discovered, it is important not to confuse service level with 
 quality of service.
  It is 
 possible to regularly and continuously meet service-level objectives and at the same time create extra work, have low 
 productivity, and provide a poor quality of service to customers. A narrow focus on service level will not necessarily 
 provide quality. CSRs can have an excellent service level but still make some or all of the following mistakes that may 
 not be reflected in service level because they are content related and not traffic related:
  
 ●     
 Relay the wrong information to callers
  
 ●     
 Make callers upset
  
 ●     
 Fail to accomplish call center objectives
  
 ●     
 Record incorrect information
  
 ●     
 Miss opportunities to capture valuable feedback",NA
Service level—a limited measure,"Service level is a limited measure of overall call center performance because it indicates only that ""not too many 
 callers had to wait longer than a certain number of seconds before reaching a CSR."" Unfortunately, service level 
 measurement devices such as those provided in an ACD cannot measure whether callers and the organization 
 achieved their mutual goals. It is important not to play the ""numbers"" game and to keep the primary objective in mind.
  
 Optimizing service level with quality is an ongoing consideration in every call center. If service level is the only 
 characteristic that is being measured and managed there can be too much emphasis on it. A good service level is an 
 enabler for other important objectives—calls are coming in and being answered so that the organization and callers 
 can achieve their mutual goals: getting information on product or services, selling products, or providing other 
 customer-oriented information.
  
 On the other hand, a poor service level reduces call center productivity. As service deteriorates, more and more 
 callers are likely to complain when calls are finally answered. CSRs will spend valuable time apologizing to callers 
 and will not be able to answer as many calls as the service level deteriorates. Costs will increase and revenues will 
 likely be affected negatively. Other negative situations will also develop. Calls will get longer because CSRs will 
 eventually pace themselves differently. And they will take breaks when they are on calls if they are so busy they 
 cannot take breaks between calls, because the ""in-between"" time no longer exists. In the longer term, as service level 
 starts to slip and continues to decline, CSRs often try to clear up the queue. If they are not able to do this, they 
 eventually adopt work habits that are detrimental to the call center. Call handling time goes up and employee moral is 
 affected and turnover and burnout increase, along with recruitment and training costs. This is obviously a disastrous 
 spiral for a call center environment.
  
 The impact of a poor service level will ultimately be felt in the quality of service offered. When CSRs are overworked 
 due to constant congestion in the queue, they often become lazy and can also become less ""customer-friendly."" 
 Callers are telling them about the difficulties they had getting through to the center, and CSRs make more mistakes 
 under these conditions. These mistakes contribute to repeat calls, unnecessary service calls, escalation of calls, and 
 complaints to higher management, callbacks, and so on—all of which drive service level down further, again 
 illustrating that a poor service level is the beginning of a vicious cycle.
  
 Based on this discussion, it is apparent that quality should never be considered as an attribute that is 
 opposite
  to 
 service level—the two must go together.",NA
Choosing a service-level objective,"The number of staff needed to handle transactions and the schedules should flow from the service-level objective. 
 (see 
 Figure 3.6
 ) Imagine",NA
Guidelines for determining service-level objectives ,"There are a number of methods for determining service-level objectives, but the following four approaches have 
 been distilled from the collective experience of call center managers:
  
  
 ●     
 Minimize abandonment",NA
Minimize abandonment,"No single service level would satisfy all situations affecting how long callers will wait for a CSR to respond. A 
 number of factors influence caller tolerance, including
  
 ●     
 How motivated callers are to reach the call center
  
 ●     
 What substitutes for a telephone call are available
  
 ●     
 The competition's service level
  
 ●     
 The caller's expectations based on past experiences
  
 ●     
 How much time the caller has
  
 ●     
 The conditions at the locations callers are calling from
  
 ●     
 Who is paying for the call
  
 The first approach to choosing a service-level objective essentially involves asking the question, 
 How low can 
 response times go without losing callers?
  This assumes that a higher level of service means lower abandonment and 
 vice versa; that is, as long as callers don't abandon, service is acceptable. But that is not always the case—
 abandonment is not static and will fluctuate as the seven factors of caller tolerance change. Abandonment is difficult 
 to forecast, and choosing a service level around abandonment is one of the least desirable ways to establish a 
 service level.",NA
Take the middle of the road—Follow the crowd,"The ""middle-of-the-road"" method defines service level as 
 percentage of calls answered in so many seconds, for 
 example, 80 percent answered in 20 seconds.
  The 80/20 objective has been cited in some ACD manuals as an 
 ""industry standard."" However, it has never been recognized as such, even though many early call centers used it. 
 The 80/20 objective is still fairly common because for many call centers it is a reasonable balance between callers' 
 expectations and the practicality of having enough staff to meet the objective.",NA
Benchmarking the competition,"Another popular method for choosing a service level is to benchmark competitors or other similar organizations and 
 then use this information as a starting point. This can be done informally by simply asking for the information or by 
 conducting a formal benchmarking study. Whatever the approach, keep in mind that the results reported and those 
 actually achieved may not reflect the actual situation. Human nature tends to ""color"" the truth on the positive side, 
 especially when the competition may have access to the responses! Cases have been documented where 
 companies with the same service level objectives—80 percent of calls answered in 30 seconds—achieved very 
 different results.
  
 A more formal way to determine the potential impact of abandonment on overall costs is 
 incremental revenue 
 analysis,
  a variation of the benchmarking approach. Traditionally, this approach has been used in revenue-
 generating environments, for example, airline or railway reservation centers and catalog companies, where calls 
 have a measurable value. It is more difficult to use in customer service centers and help desk environments, where 
 the value of calls can only be estimated. In incremental revenue analysis, a cost is attached to abandoned calls and 
 assumptions made as to how many calls would be lost at various service levels. CSRs and trunks are added as 
 long as they produce positive incrementals, either marginal/additional revenue or value, after paying for the initial 
 costs. As long as the assumptions are clearly understood and communicated to management, this approach can be 
 very useful when combined with other approaches.",NA
Customer survey,"A fourth method for choosing service level is to conduct a customer survey. This involves analyzing caller tolerance.

3.7 Creating value through workforce optimization,"Call center managers need to understand that successful management means understanding the complex trade-offs 
 inherent in the sophisticated call center operating environment, where the proper allocation, dispersal, and treatment 
 of the human resource are fundamental requirements. Quantifying and increasing the value of workforce optimization 
 solutions is important and needs to be addressed. Typically, analysis focuses on software and infrastructure 
 investments that will yield greater efficiencies resulting from automation. Some call center product vendors, however, 
 take a different approach that assesses the return on investment in the human resource, the employees in the call 
 center.",NA
Assessing value creation,"Personnel costs usually account for 70 to 80% of overall operational expenses in contact centers. Leveraging these 
 personnel resources efficiently through workforce optimization solutions can potentially provide significant returns. 
 However, most models for assessing value creation only consider the benefits derived from streamlining the 
 processes of forecasting and scheduling call center staff to meet service goals. These models may result in 
 significant gains through the automation of various functions, but they fail to address the real complexity of workforce 
 optimization and are far too simple to portray accurately the real meaning of workforce optimization.
  
 The major factors involved in managing and maximizing CSR productivity and the quality of customer interactions 
 while maximizing the number of contacts handled per agent hinge on the ability to match the volume and type of 
 customer contacts precisely. These factors include availability of agents by skill type and contact media type (e.g., 
 e-mail, phone, or fax). Done effectively, the returns for each call can be maximized and result in a maximization of 
 returns for the entire call center. (see 
 Figure 3.7
 )
  
  
 Figure 3.7: 
 Ascending levels of CSR skills experience.",NA
Staffing and customer service,"To paraphrase a well-known authority on workforce optimization, Dr. Richard Coleman, founder of Coleman 
 Consulting Group, it takes an organization as sophisticated as a contact (call) center to show how developing 
 strategic staffing plans relies on understanding the complex trade-offs inherent in each staffing scenario. The effects 
 of seemingly insignificant staffing changes are far-reaching. Staffing plans dictate the kind of service customers 
 receive and, ultimately, the profitability of customer relationships. The implementation of best practices and an 
 understanding of the mathematics behind workforce optimization, as described previously in this chapter, are 
 essential to successfully leveraging the center's human capital.
  
 Most call centers lack the tools to assess the rationale behind their service-level agreements effectively. As noted 
 previously, government regulation dictates the service level required in some industries, for example, public",NA
The customer experience,"The automation of workforce measurement is intended to ensure that customers remain loyal, that a mutually 
 profitable relationship exists and is retained, and that the impact of workforce optimization will not lead the company 
 into an unprofitable or nonviable direction. These objectives can be realized by establishing and sustaining a strong 
 customer experience. The process begins with the people who most frequently interact with customers—call center 
 employees—the mangers, supervisors, and CSRs who are the front line of customer contact.",NA
The call center employee environment,"By strengthening the link between employees and customers, workforce optimization enhances profitability. The call 
 center is often the only means for the organization to regularly interact with customers. Unfortunately, the typical 
 working environment of a call center does not foster a harmonious relationship between the company and the call 
 center employees, for several reasons:
  
 ●     
 High stress
  
 ●     
 Limited work space
  
 ●     
 Pressure
  
 ●     
 Intense and fast-paced activity
  
 ●     
 The perception of most employees of their function within the enterprise, a perception that often belies the 
 important role of the call center employee in the organization.
  
 Working in a call center can be a thankless job, and a reflection of this fact, noted previously in this book, is the 
 extremely high staff turnover relative to other industries—ranging somewhere between 20 and 35% annually. In many 
 centers, CSRs are treated as nothing more than an overhead cost rather than as critically important to increasing 
 enterprise profitability. This view is changing as corporate executives realize the importance of customer relationship 
 management (CRM) and the call center role to corporate CRM strategy. (
 Chapter 6
  describes in 
  
 detail the contribution of call centers and call center employees to an organization.) Organizations that are able to 
 channel the human potential of the call center realize a significant benefit from this corporate resource. Those that 
 succeed in positively influencing employees' attitudes about their jobs begin by including more flexibility and 
 improving job recognition. 
 Employee job satisfaction has been demonstrated to be one of the most significant 
 determinants of the quality of customer relationships.",NA
"Training, recognition, and employee empowerment","Many call center employees believe that they have little control over their own schedules and even less over how 
 their current position might translate into a career path with future growth opportunities within the organization and 
 beyond. When questioned about what can be done to improve their job satisfaction, the vast majority of employees 
 cite 
 increasing recognition for the important work they do and providing more flexibility in scheduling to allow for 
 outside commitments.
  Most CSRs would also like to have the opportunity to schedule their own enrichment training, 
 to improve their skills, or to learn about emerging technologies or products that may assist them to advance in their 
 field of employment. They also want to be able to move into higher-paying or more strategic positions within the 
 organization. In some centers, higher-skilled positions command higher salaries; for example, CSRs trained to handle 
 e-mail customer contacts often earn more than those responsible for phone communication alone.
  
 Naturally, a certain percentage of CSRs will always perceive their work as a short-term job rather than as a career, 
 but improvements in working conditions can substantially impact the turnover resulting from CSRs changing jobs for 
 slight improvements in their work environment. Anecdotal evidence from a Gartner research report indicates that 
 85% of CSRs who leave their organizations leave of their own volition, while only 15% are terminated due to poor",NA
Responding to employee needs,"One of the keys to reducing the controllable turnover percentage is to understand and respond to the changing way 
 employees view their jobs. There is a requirement for a new approach to employee concerns and, to paraphrase 
 Peter Drucker, it is change in the way companies need to treat employees ... organizations need to market 
 membership (employment in) their companies at least as much as they market products and services. People need to 
 be attracted, recognized, and rewarded. In the call center environment, increasing flexibility and allowing for a career 
 path are two ways that turnover can be curbed and a reputation as an employer of choice can be gained—a 
 reputation as an employer with such high levels of employee satisfaction that employees refer the business to 
 potential customers and employees alike.
  
 Some workforce optimization systems offered by vendors of call center services and products provide the tools and 
 best practices needed to increase efficiency and improve employee satisfaction while meeting business goals and 
 objectives. By empowering employees to manage their own time and providing some information on how their day-to-
 day activities relate to their longer-term career goals, these solutions increase employee satisfaction and loyalty. 
 Some workforce optimization products have a training component as well that offers opportunities for training on new 
 systems or products—within defined parameters—to meet customer service demands and to satisfy employees' 
 desires for more control over their careers. These products include training for new and existing employees, giving 
 them the skills necessary to meet the requirements of critical positions that need to be filled. This pays off in greater 
 efficiency for the organization because it spends fewer resources on recruiting for new positions.
  
 Call center analyst Paul Stockford of Saddletree Research has described how CRM has made companies realize that 
 customer interactions with contact or call center employees have strategic value. As a result, the strategic role of 
 these employees is rapidly being recognized. The result of a well-managed scheduling program—one that considers 
 both customer and agent attributes—has the extended effect of building loyalty among contact center agents as well, 
 with the resulting economic benefits flowing straight to the bottom line.",NA
The impact of employee loyalty,"The long-term effects of increased employee loyalty often have a greater impact than the profitability gains resulting 
 from more effective use of training and recruiting dollars. Long-term employee loyalty is critical to retaining loyal, 
 satisfied customers. Satisfied employees are more likely to refer an organization to friends and family, with the 
 potential for new customers as well as sources for recruiting new employees.
  
 As noted, the average annual turnover in call centers is between 20 and 35%, and companies spend an average of 
 $6,000–$8,000 on recruitment and training per agent. Even a marginal improvement in employee loyalty has the 
 potential to generate considerable cost savings. But significant as these numbers are, they do not begin to quantify 
 the tremendous financial benefits of the productivity gains that result from employee tenure. Especially during 
 periods of economic uncertainty, when shareholders of publicly traded companies look critically at costs and 
 earnings, controlling labor expenditures becomes even more important. Because loyal employees have critical 
 customer and corporate knowledge, the benefits of their loyalty during these times quickly spread throughout the 
 organization. Thus, using effective human resource practices and policies to keep employees satisfied results in 
 knowledge and skills staying within the organization and their continual leveraging to serve customers.",NA
Categorical knowledge,"Employees with what Aberdeen Research refers to as 
 categorical knowledge
  are able to immediately recognize 
 customer needs and act decisively and appropriately to satisfy them. These employees are far more likely to resolve 
 issues on the first call or contact than less experienced agents with the same skill. Even the most talented new 
 employee lacks the intuition and skills that come only from experience. 
  
 Veteran employees are valuable because their experience and corporate knowledge translates into less time spent 
 on each contact and greater overall productivity. A recent study by the University of Calgary further confirms the",NA
Customer loyalty and profitability,"Customers who are not completely satisfied may defect, particularly when offered a better deal, a more convenient 
 location, or the promise of a higher level of service from a competitor. When customers are fully satisfied with a 
 company's service, they will return time and again to make new purchases and to expand their relationship with the 
 organization. The secret to obtaining and retaining that elusive 
 customer loyalty
  is long-term, seasoned employees. 
 They have the power to truly satisfy customers and extend their loyalty—they know the company, the customers, and 
 how to build lasting, profitable relationships.
  
 Although solidifying relationships with employees and customers may be difficult, the effort expended will bring long-
 term benefits. In fact, reducing customer defections by as little as 
 5 percentage points
  can double profits. Studies 
 show that, over time, companies with higher customer retention rates are more profitable. Incremental increases in 
 retention rates have significant impact on profitability over the long term. Many have written about this correlation 
 between customer loyalty and company profitability. The proof can be found in some of the world's most successful 
 companies—companies like Charles Schwab, Cisco, and General Motors, to select a few household names—where 
 a direct relationship can be established among employee/customer satisfaction, loyalty, and company success. 
 These are also companies that have well-earned reputations for listening to both employee and customer needs and 
 working hard to maintain relationships with profitable customers and with seasoned employees.",NA
Conclusion: managing the primary assets,"Many organizations have made significant investments in automating and managing the customer experience in the 
 call center and at other customer contact points, but they have often forgotten the most important element: 
 the 
 people who actually determine customer loyalty and subsequently, enterprise profitability.
  Call centers are the 
 places where many of these people are located and where the customer frequently has the first contact with the 
 company.
  
 By properly managing the most important component of a call center—the human resource—and influencing how 
 employees view their jobs and how they perform their jobs in a positive way, sound personnel management practices 
 and workforce optimization systems can begin a chain of value creation that leads to closer relationships with 
 employees and more profitable relationships with customers. By assisting call center managers to manage their 
 primary assets effectively—the call center employees who are behind customer interactions—workforce optimization 
 systems are unique in their ability to impact relationships between employees and customers.
  
 Following are some convenient guidelines for evaluating how well a corporate call center is optimizing the potential 
 of its human resources with good management practices. They indicate how the implementation of workforce 
 optimization systems can benefit the organization.

3.8 Disaster and contingency planning in call centers,"An important aspect of managing a corporate facility-one that includes resources, equipment, and people-is disaster 
 and contingency planning. There are several reasons why a disaster and contingency plan should be put in place by 
 every call center operation, and should be rehearsed, like a fire drill, periodically. Not the least of these reasons is 
 maintaining call center services in the face of natural or human disasters. Many problems or contingencies can arise 
 that result in a call center being shut down and customer communication lost, possibly for an extended period, if 
 alternative arrangements have not been made.",NA
Downtime,"Several situations can result in call center downtime: natural disasters-storms, snow, flooding-can keep people from 
 getting to the center; construction, often the bane of those who need to maintain continuous communication services 
 because of frequent disruptions to power, cable, or telephone lines; fire; power spikes; cable cuts; computer crashes; 
 and network outages-all can very quickly cut communication links to the outside world. While these disturbances may 
 be localized, affecting only a small number of centers, the cost of downtime to any center hit by a temporary 
 shutdown can be enormous. This is why it is critical for call centers to invest in disaster contingency planning, with the 
 hope that it may never have to be implemented but if required the center and staff are well prepared.",NA
Coping with emergency situations,"The following procedures for coping with emergency situations have been developed from the experience of many 
 call centers.",NA
Identify key systems at risk in a disaster or emergency situation,"Some of these systems are obvious-switching technology, data processing equipment, and so on. How vulnerable is 
 the business if the package delivery/ courier service is not available? Labor trouble in these service organizations can 
 shut a business down. Orders may be taken over the phone, but if they can't be delivered, customers may stay away. 
 Because all organizations depend on other companies, every service that is outsourced is particularly vulnerable, 
 especially order fulfillment, personnel supply, and service and maintenance on internal equipment.
  
 If outside services are critical to continuous operation, there are essentially two choices for setting up a contingency 
 plan:
  
 ●     
 Single-source services, ensuring that vendors have enough redundancy or extra capacity to handle defined 
 contingencies
  
 ●     
 Multisource services to provide backup in case the primary vendor has difficulty meeting contractual obligations
  
 As noted, contingency planning needs to be applied to every service, from courier services to communication 
 resources such as long-distance services. Organizations that are service providers need to inform customers of 
 contingency plans to ensure continued service in case of snow, fire, or other short- and medium-term 
 emergencies.",NA
Conduct a cablinglwiringlpower assessment,"Map out every wire and connection in the center with a pictorial interconnection diagram showing the connections 
 between technologies. This will make it possible to check the power protection status of every server, PC, switch, and 
 node. A critical assessment will identify which items are covered by UPS (uninterruptible power supply) units, which 
 have hot-swappable power supplies, and which systems require these resources.
  
 Telephone systems are particularly vulnerable to lightning strikes, and a protection mechanism should be in place to 
 prevent outages in phone service. A lightning strike could short out all phone sets and headsets, leaving CSRs with 
 working computers and incoming ACD calls that cannot be answered.",NA
Identify manual work procedures,"A contingency plan should provide for manual order taking if the computer systems go down. Make sure there are 
 always enough hard copies of current product or service catalogs for every inbound CSR so that basic pricing and",NA
Identify key personnel,"It's important to know who will be on call during a problem situation and the specific responsibilities of those 
 personnel. Every staff member should be briefed on his or her responsibilities in an emergency.
  
 Any working group convened for call center contingency planning should include members from other departments, 
 especially people from IT and the facilities management departments, in order to share knowledge. They need to be 
 made aware of the impact call center failure could have on the entire company and on the company's revenue 
 stream. Personnel from other departments need to provide coordinated responses to problems that affect data 
 processing, order processing, shipping, the availability of human resources-in fact, every aspect of the business.",NA
Explore secondary operating sites,"Sometimes, the only way truly to prevent disasters is to replicate call center functions in another location. If there's a 
 flood, fire, or natural disaster that affects the central operation, CSRs can continue to operate from another location. 
 Doing this could be as simple as using non call center assets (basic office space, for example) or as complex as 
 arranging to buy contingency services from organizations that provide disaster and contingency services. There are 
 also companies that offer to operate an entire call center from alternative sites in any location, for a substantial fee. 
 These ""call centers on call"" are not traditional outsourcing services. User organizations pay a retainer to have access 
 to their services as required, such as in an extreme emergency. Disaster-oriented services can provide a range of 
 resources, including equipment, temporary (often mobile) facilities, and data processing and backup functions, as 
 well.
  
 These are only a few of the options available. It is important to remember that the continued operation of a call center 
 depends on a complex set of connected technologies that are vulnerable to circumstances outside the control of call 
 center management.",NA
Power protection,"Power is one of the company's most serious resources that require protection. When a call center goes down, 
 company revenues stop flowing. Call center downtime, whether caused by natural or human disasters, is to be 
 avoided at all costs. Downtime means customer calls are not coming in, orders are not being taken, and customers 
 are getting impatient, even angry. They will turn to other companies to meet their needs. Thus, protecting the center 
 from power outages is an important function that must be performed from the first day of operation.
  
 One of the most common causes of downtime is failure of the electrical power system, often without warning, an 
 event that will take a call center ""off the air,"" usually for some time. Backup power sources are mandatory to prevent 
 downtime due to power outages. The IVR (interactive voice response) system is a good example of a technology 
 resource that will be out of service in a power failure. Once a call center has become dependent on IVR, it becomes 
 a crucial part of the enterprise-handling a substantial amount of call traffic, promoting customer satisfaction, and 
 generating revenue. In some cases, the IVR system handles all inbound calls, either directly or by passing them 
 back to CSRs through an ACD. In this situation, loss of IVR would be as serious as loss of phone service.
  
 Some facts about power problems that can help a call center manager prepare for power outages in the most 
 effective manner are
  
 ●     
 Power problems are the single most frequent cause of phone and computer system failure.
  Surveys indicate 
 that the average IVR system has a significant power fluctuation (spike, surge, or brownout) approximately 400 
 times a year. Increasing consumption in regional power grids will only exacerbate the problem.
  
 ●     
 Power-related damage is one of the most difficult types of damage to recover from.
  This form of damage creates 
 two problems: It can destroy hardware, often necessitating costly, time-consuming replacements, and it wipes out 
 data.",NA

Auditing disaster and contingency plans,"There are two major components to a successful disaster and contingency recovery strategy. The first is 
 contingency 
 planning,
  which involves identifying all the elements critical to the call center operation: people, processes and 
 equipment. It also means planning for situations where these elements will not be available with backup strategies for 
 a variety of emergency conditions. The second component is 
 installing a technology net
  that includes power 
 protection, backup power supplies, redundant trunks and carriers, and duplicating any other resources that may be 
 required in an emergency.
  
 To ensure complete protection of the call center, an audit of disaster and contingency plans should also include the 
 following activities:
  
 ●     
 Document every aspect of the center
 -from wiring runs to home phone numbers of all critical personnel. This 
 activity includes putting all plans on paper so they will survive a network crash. Staff members need to know 
 where the plans are stored and have quick access to them.
  
 ●     
 Conduct emergency drills involving all staff
 -so they are well prepared for a real emergency. They need to know 
 their roles and how to keep the center operating.
  
 ●     
 Identify potential risks
 -depending on the geographic location of the center, there may be greater likelihood 
 of an emergency involving a snowstorm than an earthquake.
  
 ●     
 Conduct a power audit
 -UPS devices are designed with the assumption that building wiring will provide proper 
 routes to ground and has sufficient load capacity to control diverted power surges. Ensure that building power 
 circuitry meets this requirement.
  
 What needs to be protected? Identify exactly what systems are particularly critical and which are less critical and 
 nonessential in the short term to the continued operation of the center. Establish priorities. Is it more important to be 
 able to take orders? Or provide service? Thinking about these priorities will provide useful insight into the way the call 
 center fits into the company's overall business process.
  
 The key objective in disaster and contingency planning is to take precautions to ensure a minimum continuity of 
 function and connection to customers. The call center is one of a company's most vulnerable departments because 
 it has several complex core technologies and the loss of its operational capabilities means being cut off from 
 customers; therefore, its recovery should be a top priority.",NA
3.9 Outsourcing the call center,"Setting up an outsourcing vendor for a corporate call center is a complex task. Putting all of the company's corporate 
 eggs in an outsourcing basket may give many call center managers some uneasy moments. It's difficult enough to 
 ensure that a company's own employees are managing customer relationships correctly. The outsourcing 
 organization is being asked to handle an extremely valuable corporate asset: 
 the customer relationship.
  The 
 importance of this aspect of a corporation's business operations cannot be overemphasized, as will be shown in 
 greater detail in 
 Chapter 6
 , ""Building Customer Relationships with Call Centers.""
  
 Market studies and analysis of the views of call center managers regarding outsourcing reveal widespread 
 concern over the benefits of outsourcing. In one recent user study, users reported higher satisfaction levels with 
 in-house call centers than with outsourced call center services. Nevertheless, another report from IDC on the 
 worldwide call center services industry indicates that it will grow to $58.6 billion by 2003 based on three segments 
 of the call center services market: consulting, systems integration, and outsourcing. Outsourcing was reported to 
 be the largest segment, with 74% of the total market, or $42 billion by 2003.
  
 Call center outsourcing will continue to grow at a strong pace; however, the growth comes with a price tag. Users of 
 outsourcing services are concerned, as they should be, with ""staff competence,"" ""flexibility,"" and ""the caliber of 
 operations"" at their outsourced centers. The outsourcing business has grown rapidly over the past several years, 
 however, because, by and large, outsourcers do provide good service, and companies need the service, the 
 expertise and the technology provided by these organizations.",NA
Outsourcing and maintaining customer relationships,"The outsourcing sector is a very large component of an even larger call center industry, and it is undergoing continual 
 change. Just as in-house call centers need continual monitoring and upgrading, so do outsourced centers. As well, 
 managers who opt for an outsourced call center are beginning to realize how critical customer relationships are and 
 are understandably concerned about losing control over corporate strategies. Turning sensitive service and revenue 
 tasks over to an outside vendor creates stresses that are reflected in tentative satisfaction ratings. It is important for 
 clients of outsourcing operations to manage their relationships just as if the centers were in house.",NA
The fragile business of outsourcing,"Outsourcing companies are a major component of the ""teleservices"" industry and are often the subject of adverse 
 reports in the media, especially if they are public companies. In general, outsourcing centers are larger than in-house 
 centers and are often comprised of networks of interlinked centers. As noted, they are subject to the same human 
 resources problems—high turnover and employee burnout—as any other sector of the teleservices industry.
  
 Growth in the outsourcing business has brought pressure to bear on these operations, requiring them to be very 
 productive and to reflect the corporate cultures of their client organizations. For a variety of reasons, outsourcing 
 services are a fragile element of the call center service market. Outsourcers must cater to a customer base that 
 demands the highest levels of technology and insists that outsourcers provide very sophisticated off-premise 
 technology that can be integrated into their own existing systems. The services provided by outsourcers are a luxury 
 for many client organizations and will be scaled back during bad times to reduce costs and will likely become very 
 price competitive. All of the negative business factors that affect in-house call centers have an even greater impact on 
 outsourced centers: shortage of qualified labor, capital costs of keeping pace with demand and new technology, and 
 the introduction of unproven, innovative technologies, such as Web/call center combinations.
  
 For these reasons, it is difficult to turn a profit in the call center outsourcing business, yet many organizations are 
 attracted to the business opportunity and are willing to ""buck the odds."" The business opportunity that attracts 
 outsourcers is the growth of new businesses that require some form of call center or customer contact service in 
 their formative stages. Often, when a company is growing the only way to keep up with an expanding customer 
 base is to rely on outside resources. Traditionally, outsourcers have functioned as a bridge—handling high call 
 volumes during peak seasons or during product launches.
  
 Outsourcing is a good technique for testing new concepts, products, or services without incurring capital expenses. A 
 new campaign can be tested on an outbound list without incurring the costs involved in buying communications 
 equipment or hiring additional employees. Outsourcers can offer the latest technologies in the most sophisticated 
 implementations and can readily handle short-term requirements very well.",NA
Managing the relationship,"The relationship between a company and its outsourcer needs to be managed in the same way as the relationship 
 between a company and

Making the move,"Moving to an outsourcing facility is a business decision that is often difficult to make due to ""fear of the unknown."" 
 When an organization manages its own in-house call center, the strengths and weaknesses of people working in the 
 center are known and managers have learned how to use these characteristics for best effect. Also, acknowledging 
 the necessity to move to outsourcing, especially for the smaller, growing company, can be dispiriting. The sense that 
 you are losing touch with customers, not to mention having to rely on outsourcing personnel who represent an 
 unknown human resource quantity, can be an unsettling experience, not only for the call center manager but also for 
 other internal department heads charged with the responsibility of contracting with an outsourcer and working with 
 that organization.",NA
Some pointers for outsourcers,"The outsourcing/client relationship is an extremely important one and should be well thought out before any 
 agreement is signed. The successful outsourcing organization needs to emphasize the connection it offers 
 between the client company and its customers and prospects. They need to rely on their experience, and that 
 of their CSRs, to develop confidence among their client organizations.
  
 Outsourcers have access to a range of technology tools that enable their client companies to closely monitor their 
 communication with the client company's customers closer to the point of interaction—real-time reporting tools are 
 one example. A client sees the results of calls (inbound or outbound) without having to take those calls itself. Other 
 tools—monitoring and quality assurance systems—can deliver complete voice and data records of each call to the 
 client, if required. Like any other service organization, outsourcers must take responsibility for the quality and nature 
 of their services, and should be held accountable by their clients for any errors of commission or omission.",NA
Telephone companies as outsourcers,"Telephone companies, also referred to as 
 telcos
  or 
 carriers
  in this book, are a major component of the teleservices 
 industry. They provide the communications infrastructure—cable, satellite, networking facilities, and other equipment 
 essential to every form of electronic communication—and carry voice, data, or video data, both digital and analog. 
 Using their vast networks of communications resources, telcos often provide call center outsourcing facilities as one 
 element of their communication services to customers. There is some advantage to using a telephone carrier to 
 provide outsourcing. For one thing, they undoubtedly have available the most current communication, networking,",NA
Telco service offerings,"Often, the outsourcing services offered by telcos are quite comprehensive and may include
  
 file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0026.html (2 von 6) [20.09.2007 19:03:21]",NA
Increased revenues for telcos,"For the carriers, the economics of providing outsourcing services are extremely attractive. Carriers generate much of 
 their revenue by selling telecom minutes to call centers as well as to others. The 800 number traffic, the bread and 
 butter of call centers, is also a key component of their revenue. Anything they can do to generate usage of their 
 networks will enhance their revenues. Both providing a call center with an off-premise solution for IVR or a multisite 
 option that lets the company hold calls in the network while waiting for an agent to become available are services that 
 generate time usage. Discounts that bring long-distance costs closer to zero cents per minute may be offered to telco 
 call center customers who elect to contract for these value-added services. (see 
 Figure 3.8
 )
  
  
 Figure 3.8: 
 The 800 network. 
  
 Over time, carriers will gradually enhance their call centers by including agents and will eventually provide the 
 same services as any other outsourcer. Some carriers have already taken on the role of call center 
 ""consolidators""—combining all the technology pieces under one contract.",NA
Benefits of telcos as outsourcers,NA,NA
Choices to benefit the outsourcing customer,"The more choices that call center users have, the better. The next few years will probably see a tremendous boom in 
 the types of services a call center can outsource to a carrier network. Carriers will offer all the automated front-end 
 transactions, especially IVR, and routing will be well handled outside the call center.
  
 As a result of carriers ""getting serious"" about the outsourcing business, outsourcing will become specialized. For 
 example, if a call center application has more to do with routing and automated call handling, the carrier may well be 
 a better choice than the outsourcing vendor. On the other hand, if the application is more agent-oriented and involves 
 customer-sensitive services like selling or servicing existing customers, a traditional outsourcer may be better 
 qualified to provide the service.",NA
Value-added services from carriers,"Network services are being provided by the network carrier in the telecom network outside of traditional premise-
 based call center equipment. This can be a significant source of revenue for carriers because they can reduce toll-
 free services to a very low level and more than make up the difference by selling other services as value-added 
 features. Networked services can provide virtual or distributed call centering, dispersing CSRs among many centers 
 and routing calls among them as if they were all located at one site. Also included under the network services 
 umbrellas is IVR, which extracts the customer input from the network, then uses this input to determine how to 
 handle the call.",NA
Web integration services,"Web integration services are another burgeoning area of activity for call centers that network carriers can help them 
 with. The technologies involved and the expansion of customer contact points pose significant contact management 
 problems for call centers. Managers now need to cope with the technical and human resources issues that have 
 cropped up from the explosion of Web access channels to the center. Live text-chat, call-me buttons, and even 
 simple e-mail messages can create additional handling requirements for CSRs and managers alike.
  
 Using the network to provide some automated handling of evolving customer contact channels—particularly IVR—is 
 something telcos have been doing for years. They have always had the technology and the equipment to do this. 
 When Centrex ACD facilities and the increasing demand for multisite centers are added to the picture, telcos are in 
 an enviable position to offer a range of outsourcing services. For a call center, outsourcing network-based services, 
 paid for either monthly or by transaction, offers a way to be more flexible in the face of unpredictable volume and 
 varied access pathways.
  
 Predicted growth patterns for the first five or more years of the 21st century indicate that there will be a lot of voice 
 over IP (VoIP), even at the desktop, and a shortage of available and qualified CSRs to work in call centers, which 
 will lead to an increase in home-based, telecommuting CSRs in some sectors. Pressure will therefore come from 
 both call center organizations and the outsourcing community to move to network-based services. The growth of e-
 commerce and the electronic forms of communication that are a part of this business environment will make it 
 extremely difficult to predict how many transactions will be handled electronically, rather than by live CSRs. From 
 the carriers' perspective, increased competition is forcing them to look at service offerings as a way to differentiate 
 their organizations from others in the business.
  
 Ultimately, all of these new methods of conducting business, along with their technologies, will represent an 
 opportunity for call centers to play mix-and-match with their technology and outsourced services. Network-based 
 services will offer a suitable and acceptable alternative to premise-based equipment for a lot of centers and result in 
 new ways of managing the call center operation.",NA
Outsourcing and network-based call center services,NA,NA
The high-tech outsourcers,"Another interesting development in recent years is the evolution of some high-tech companies into major 
 outsourcers, largely due to the requirements of their customers for consulting services relating to their products 
 or services.
  
 As call centers become more widely distributed and provide more business functions, the companies that provide 
 products and services to call centers will also change. There is considerable emphasis within outsourcing 
 organizations on the advanced computer telephony integration (CTI) technology described in 
 Chapter 2
  as well as 
 technology for linking call centers with other back-office operations. 
  
 Outsourcers are becoming ""engines of growth"" in the call center industry.",NA
Outsourcers and specialty niches,"Outsourcers often provide an entree into specialty markets, either geographic or language-oriented. Some of them 
 provide multilingual capabilities to enable organizations to conduct campaigns in other countries and often globally. 
 As noted, other outsourcers provide services to specific industry sectors, such as retailing, financial institutions, 
 fundraisers, collections, communication, and high technology.",NA
The future of the traditional outsourcer,"Traditional outsourcers will continue to be a mainstay of the industry. Although carriers are superbly positioned to 
 provide outsourcing services, this business component is not their main focus, and it is unlikely that carriers will ever 
 replace outsourcer organizations that make outsourcing their core business and therefore concentrate on providing 
 call center services to their customers. Further evidence of this is that opportunities for outsourcing have been 
 available for some years, yet only recently have carriers discovered the market for enhanced services, and they do 
 not have a good track record of developing products from technologies. Traditional outsourcers will undoubtedly 
 retain the competitive advantage.
  
 Carriers tend to be slow to enter new markets and develop new products. This appears to be a characteristic of the 
 telco marketplace and is probably a relic left over from the monopoly positions they held for many years in the 
 communications industry. No need to hurry, there is no competition anyway! Carriers are often referred to as ""Ma 
 Bells,"" an oblique reference to the fact that they have a tendency to ""mother"" their services and products far too long 
 before introducing them. As a result, they are often left behind by competitors who are not encumbered by the 
 traditions of the monopolies once held by the telcos.
  
 In the past, outsourcers were considered to be primarily outbound entities, providing a range of telemarketing 
 services to organizations that did not have their own telemarketing facilities or that needed some additional resources 
 to run a marketing campaign or customer survey. From this basic entree into the call center market, outsourcing 
 services have evolved and become much broader and more sophisticated. In fact, outsourcing services now offered 
 go well beyond the original concept of an outsourcing organization. Back-office functions are now offered by 
 outsourcers, and their range of services may include inbound and outbound call handling, customer tracking, quality 
 assurance, fulfillment, data processing, and even help desk customer support—a considerable enhancement of their 
 traditional services.
  
 Customer support or, as it has become known in many industry sectors, the 
 help desk,
  is one area that more and 
 more companies are contracting to outside experts. This is especially true in such industry sectors as personal 
 computers and home electronics, where there may be a high volume of customer support inquiries following 
 purchases that the vendor is not staffed to handle. The advanced technologies that enable calls to be routed and 
 tracked make the help desk function easier and more cost-effective. As postsales customer support becomes 
 simultaneously more important and more expensive, companies are looking for lower-cost alternatives that don't force 
 them to compromise on the quality and level of response.",NA
Challenges and pressures,NA,NA
Summarizing the benefits of outsourcing,"From the preceding description of outsourcing, it should be apparent that the benefits to organizations choosing 
 the outsourcing route for their call center operations are not many; they can, however, be significant in content. 
 The following summarizes the three major benefits:
  
 ●     
 Access to advanced technologies
 —capital investments in switches, dialers, and workstations and upgrades to 
 hardware and software are all managed by the outsourcing organization, which is generally equipped with 
 state-of-the-art call center systems. Costs can be spread over multiple clients.
  
 ●     
 Vertical expertise
 —specialized industry-oriented expertise is offered to meet the needs of financial institutions, 
 fundraising organizations, and retailers, among others. In fact, outsourcers for most industry sectors know how 
 vertical markets function and how to treat customers in those markets.
  
 ●     
 Speed
 —seasonal or even more frequent fluctuations in the number of CSRs that a particular marketing 
 program may need can be addressed quickly.",NA
Chapter 4: ,NA,NA
Selecting and Training Call Center Staff,"This chapter describes recommended selection criteria for call center CSRs, supervisors, and managers as well as 
 training course content and syllabus topics for all three categories of staff. The number of personnel in each of 
 these categories and the training requirements in a given call center will obviously depend on the size of the call 
 center, that is, how many ""seats"" there are in the center.
  
 Staff selection and training are important aspects of every call/contact center operation and can be significant 
 determining factors in their effectiveness and productivity. CSRs are the prime human resource focus of the call 
 center, as they should be, because they are the first point of contact with the customer. Supervisors are usually 
 responsible for managing a certain number of CSRs, and managers may have the overall responsibility for the call 
 center operation. Managers and supervisors responsible for operating the sophisticated environment of the modern 
 call center need to be knowledgeable in many areas, including business, team leadership, motivation, counseling, 
 mentoring, scheduling, complaint handling, and incentive programs, as well as being able to communicate an 
 organization's business and objectives. 
  
 Most centers do not train their supervisors in these skills, nor do they evaluate candidates for these skills during the 
 candidate selection process. This situation has to change if the call center operation is to be successful in meeting 
 an organization's business objectives and its customer relationship strategy. This chapter provides recommended 
 evaluation criteria for new call center employees, as well as specific course outlines for staff training sessions.",NA
4.1 Overview,"The type of training that most successful centers provide to CSRs, supervisors, and managers heavily 
 emphasizes business training and handling a wide range of call situations. Supervisor and management training 
 programs should not be the extent of the learning process, however. Ongoing learning should also include 
 attending industry conferences and reading trade publications. Networking with other call center supervisors and 
 managers is also a good source of learning and acquiring useful knowledge.",NA
Testing the waters,"It is easier for CSRs to make the transition to supervise if they have been well prepared during their time on the front 
 lines. CSRs who exceed performance objectives, demonstrate leadership abilities, communicate well, are technically 
 competent, and have high-level customer service skills should be offered the opportunity to learn other functions and 
 to move into management positions. Call center managers should continually seek out CSRs who are interested in 
 learning and should find learning opportunities for those CSRs who express an interest in a particular area. For 
 example, for CSRs who express the desire to become trainers, managers should provide opportunities for these 
 individuals to help out with the training group, either by assisting in training development or even conducting a 
 training session. Other occasions for these CSRs to try out their management or training skills occur, for example, 
 when a supervisor is out of the center for an extended period of time (e.g., on maternity or medical leave or holidays). 
 On such occasions, a senior-level agent could be asked to be an interim team leader. CSRs aspiring to management 
 roles can also be encouraged to represent their call centers in organizationwide, cross-functional project meetings.
  
 Developing formal and informal methods of nurturing and growing aspiring CSRs into call center supervisors and 
 managers may be time-intensive, but it is also necessary to ensure a successful transition into management. It is 
 difficult for people to be placed in a leadership situation when they are not prepared for the role, either formally or 
 informally.",NA
Motivating call center employees,"The aspects of the work environment that motivate call center employees are the same ones that motivate 
 employees in any other work environment, plus some that take into account the special responsibilities of call center 
 staff. These motivational factors, not necessarily in order of significance, can be summarized as follows:
  
 ●     
 Wages
  
 ●     
 Working conditions
  
 ●     
 Work challenges",NA
Some general training issues,"In general, it is important to develop a knowledge and skills matrix and curricula that identify the initial and ongoing 
 training needs of CSRs, supervisors, and managers. A reevaluation of skills should be done on a regular schedule to 
 ensure that adequate training is being provided and that there are reference points for defining ""subject expertise."" It 
 is also important to ensure that call-handling guidelines and other procedures be well documented and available at 
 the CSR's desktop for quick reference. Specific training requirements may differ from one organization to another; 
 however, there are a number of common, key elements that should be incorporated into any initial training program, 
 including
  
 ●     
 Knowledge of the organization, including its mission, vision and core values, key performance objectives, office 
 values, and business strategies
  
 ●     
 Product knowledge—products and services of the organization, including key use, benefits, and pricing (if 
 appropriate)
  
 ●     
 Customer knowledge, including customer profiles
  
 ●     
 Communication skills, including voice skills and call-handling strategies, use of voice mail and e-mail
  
 ●     
 Guidelines for procedures, escalations, quality calls, and monitoring
  
 ●     
 Customer escalation procedures
  
 ●     
 Computer systems
  
 ●     
 Office procedures and hours of operation
  
 An induction and training manual should be developed and should document the entire training program, including 
 lesson plan, facilitator's guide, overhead transparencies, and workshop manuals.
  
 Managers and supervisors/team leaders should undergo management training to provide them with an in-depth 
 understanding of call center management principles. This knowledge is essential for effective day-to-day 
 management of a well-run center and should cover the following topics:
  
 ●     
 Performance management
  
 ●     
 Service-level management
  
 ●     
 Cost of call management
  
 ●     
 Monitoring, analyzing, and coaching
  
 In addition, all call center staff, including supervisors, managers, and support staff, should undergo customer service 
 and sales skills training as part of their initial training programs.",NA
Training strategies,"A wide variety of training methods can be employed to facilitate training: classroom activities, call observation, 
 product knowledge tests, one-on-one coaching, and on-line tutorials. Self-paced training aids should be provided for 
 individual reference and self-learning; some training aids, often referred to as 
 tool kits,
  (described later in this chapter) 
 are specifically designed for the call center environment and written in the form of modules with workbooks and 
 audiotapes. Most centers employ several or all of these methods, depending on the training curriculum.
  
 Supervisors and managers are promoted from within in many call centers, being selected from among the best 
 agents and those who demonstrate leadership qualities. These leaders will provide CSR staff with the ""voice"" of the 
 organization. They need to be well trained and brought up-to-date frequently. It is therefore important, as an 
 investment in the future of the organization, to provide ongoing training to both new and upcoming supervisors. This 
 training should include a thorough grounding in how to run an effective and efficient call center—from 
 communication skills and workforce measurement techniques to using tools such as Erlang C for measuring service 
 levels, as well as the range of technologies available.
  
 The following sections describe recommended selection criteria for call center staff as well as training guidelines for 
 each level.",NA
4.2 Staff selection criteria,"The high cost associated with the staffing, training, and relatively high turnover rates in call centers makes it 
 extremely important that recruiting processes ensure the best possible hires. The first major decision is whether to 
 conduct the search internally or externally, using a recruiting agency, or to use a combination of both. If an 
 organization has no experience in the recruitment and selection of call center personnel, then one option is to use a 
 specialized recruitment agency. There are many general recruitment agencies, but it is important to select an agency 
 with extensive experience in selecting call center personnel.
  
 Call centers have unique selection and hiring challenges. Distinct skills and abilities are required when a brief 
 telephone conversation or typed response to an e-mail is the only contact. Call center CSRs must listen, speak, 
 read, type, and analyze all at the same time. Supervisors, team leaders, and managers must possess many of the 
 same skills, along with business/staff management competencies and experience. They will also need to 
 understand voice systems, data collection and interpretation, contact flow, and cost per call.
  
 Telephone interviewing of candidates for all three levels of call center jobs is an essential part of the selection 
 process. The aim of the telephone interview is to establish candidates' work experience, communication skills, 
 telephone voice skills, and selling ability (if applicable). It will also reveal their attitude, enthusiasm, and the creativity 
 of their telephone performance. Another important part of the selection process is role playing, which provides an 
 opportunity to assess how good the applicants are at communicating and selling themselves. Three different role-play 
 scenarios should be used to test the extent of a candidate's customer service orientation, communication skills, ability 
 to handle complaints, and phone selling skills.
  
 The following sections list some of the special skills and competencies that are important skillsets for the call center 
 operating environment and provide some criteria for recruiting and selecting of CSRs, supervisors, and managers.",NA

Supervisors/team leaders ,"Recruiting supervisors/team leaders is similar to CSR recruitment but will emphasize different skills. For this level, 
 experience in leading and managing teams within a call center environment is an important criterion. Interview 
 questions should address these skills and the interview should include role-playing based on specific scenarios 
 involving motivating, coaching, and counseling team members.
  
 The following skillsets are important attributes for supervisors and team leaders:

Managers ,"The strategic importance of the call center manager to the establishment and effective operation of the center 
 requires special consideration in recruitment and selection, which may therefore involve an executive search or 
 external recruitment agency that specializes in this type of recruitment. Call center managers should possess the 
 following skillsets:
  
  
 ●     
 Ability to effectively lead and manage the call center
  
  
 ●     
 High-level communications skills
  
  
 ●     
 Ability to achieve agreed-upon targets and key performance indicators
  
  
 ●     
 Ability to effectively manage resources within defined budgets
  
  
 ●     
 High-level focus on continuous improvement",NA
4.3 Training CSR staff,"As noted previously, a wide variety of training programs and methods for call center training 
 programs exist, including,
 ●     
 Classroom activities—workshops, seminars
  
 ●     
 Call observation
  
 ●     
 Product knowledge tests
  
 ●     
 One-on-one monitoring and coaching
  
 ●     
 On-line tutorials
  
 ●     
 Tool kits
  
 Call-handling guidelines should be fully documented and communicated to CSRs on a continuous basis. 
 Documentation should be included in initial CSR training and available at the CSR workstation for quick reference. 
 These standards become part of individual and center performance measurements and are the basis of CSR 
 assessment using call monitoring or other performance measurements. In addition to initial training, CSRs should 
 have ongoing training, which may focus on new technologies, sales or help desk skills, collections, or other topics 
 that can improve the knowledge and skill level of CSRs.
  
 Examples of recommended CSR workshop topics for half-day, one-day, and two-day training sessions are provided 
 next. The CSR workshops described are examples of training syllabuses that provide participants with the foundation 
 knowledge and skills required for individual and team success. Along with an emphasis on handling a variety of 
 customer communications, are included the ""why"" of customer relations, customer requirements, the changing 
 demands and expectations of customers, good and bad customer service, and how to exceed expectations.",NA

4.5 Tool kits,"Typically, tool kits are self-paced programs consisting of a number of modules that CSRs can use to study alone 
 or in small groups. Using workbooks and audiocassettes, a CSR can complete a module and be back on line in 
 less than 45 minutes. In some instances, working through the exercises alone is all that's necessary; in other 
 cases, a CSR will work with a coach or peer to obtain feedback on his or her progress. The kits include a matrix 
 describing the specific skill or knowledge gaps each module covers. This means that a CSR's training efforts can 
 be focused on particular area(s) of need. Tool kits are available to assist CSRs in developing and refining the

4.7 Training supervisory and management staff,"The benefits of promoting CSRs to supervisory and management positions from within the call center have been 
 mentioned previously. This process will be successful providing internal or external training programs are made 
 available to these employees to assist them in following a call center career path. The primary benefits to the 
 organization of promoting from within are that employees who have gone the CSR route know the business, 
 customers, staff, and corporate culture. As most organizations will understand, an internal career path is a great 
 motivator for other CSRs—particularly when support is provided to their former peers to help them succeed in their 
 new roles. Whether or not CSRs are promoted from within, or brought in from outside the call center to fill supervisory 
 or management positions, however, training should be made available to help these individuals perform their new 
 roles effectively.",NA
Leadership skills training is critical,"For centers with a career development program that provides CSRs opportunities to regularly move ""up the ladder,"" it 
 is essential to develop a formal curriculum and time frame for supervisory training. Adapting to a supervisory or 
 management role in an environment where the individual has been a peer to other CSRs can be a difficult transition. 
 Supervising former fellow CSRs and becoming a team leader, instead of just a team member, is not easy for some. 
 However, the transition needs to be made by those CSRs who want to follow a career path in call center 
 management in order to move into supervisory or management positions. Although not every CSR will aspire to a 
 supervisory or management position, there should be a recognized and well-established career path for those who 
 do.
  
 In addition to the more specific training required for call center supervisory and management personnel, additional 
 leadership training, which includes managing tasks as well as leading people, is essential.",NA
Personal development topics for managers and supervisors,"Any supervisory training program, whether formal or informal, should include such call center management topics 
 as forecasting, workforce management, planning and scheduling, and using technology in addition to training in 
 basic leadership skills. The following key areas for personal development of supervisory and management 
 personnel are recommended in a supervisory training program:
  
 ●     
 Customer interaction
  
 ●     
 Employee interaction
  
 ●     
 Team leadership
  
 ●     
 Decision making
  
 ●     
 Employee motivation and recognition
  
 ●     
 Communication
  
 ●     
 Systems manipulations
  
 ●     
 High-level problem solving
  
 ●

Planning the curriculum,file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0033.html (1 von 5) [20.09.2007 19:03:25],NA
Staff input,"Once an initial training plan has been developed, consult with a team of call center managers, supervisors, CSRs, 
 and in-house trainers, if any, and analyze the training requirements. Determine where opportunities lie and then 
 prioritize them, based on the following guidelines:
  
 ●     
 Select training topics that will provide the biggest return in the quickest amount of time
  
 ●     
 Schedule training sessions for mutual availability of training resources and call center staff
  
 List the top-five training opportunities for supervisors and then determine the best way to deliver the training. To test 
 the training plan, select a pilot team to undergo the training and act as a focus group to review and modify the 
 curriculum.
  
 The experience of many call center managers points up the importance of defining expectations in order that CSRs 
 can fulfill them. If they demonstrate they can do this, then it's really in the best interest of the customer, the 
 employees, and the company to move these people into positions of more responsibility—because they've 
 demonstrated they can do the job. They can also bring the customer's perspective with them to the supervisory or 
 management role.",NA
Develop clear performance guidelines,"In addition to training and providing early growth opportunities, management can ensure the success of new 
 supervisors by developing clear, consistent guidelines and expectations. These expectations should be objective and 
 measurable and provide feedback to frontline staff on what their performance gaps are and how they can work 
 toward closing them. Opportunities should be provided in the call center to actually develop competencies in a way 
 that shows people are ready for additional assignments or responsibilities.",NA
Supervisory and management workshops,NA,NA
Monitoring and coaching guidelines,"As noted previously in this handbook, monitoring is a sensitive issue with CSRs and should be carefully 
 planned and implemented. Therefore, once the monitoring/coaching program has been designed, it needs to 
 be discussed and agreed upon by both CSRs and management to ensure mutual understanding and 
 acceptance.
  
 One commonly accepted rule of thumb for monitoring is that it should be done on the basis of 10 calls per rep every 
 two weeks. Some of the issues that need to be addressed in monitoring and coaching CSRs are
  
 ●     
 Why monitor?
  Will it identify areas for additional training, enhance individual skills, and improve quality and 
 productivity?
  
 ●     
 How will monitoring be done?
  Will it be remote and/or side-by-side, will calls be taped, what is being monitored 
 (voice, desktop, or both)?
  
 ●     
 What is being evaluated?
  Quality of problem resolution, tone of voice, ability to capture important detail, 
 questioning techniques, sales and customer service skills?
  
 ●     
 Who will be monitoring?
  Manager, supervisor, trainer, peers?
  
 ●     
 When will it be done?
  Random, daily, one call per rep per day?
  
 ●     
 How will performance be measured?
  Metrics, scoring, accuracy, objective versus subjective, cumulative results 
 rather than one-time event (unless specific coaching is required at that time)?
  
 ●     
 How will feedback be given?
  Frequency, what data, one-on-one?
  
 ●     
 How will personal calls be handled to ensure privacy?",NA
4.8 Summary: meeting objectives,"The overall goal of selecting the right individuals for the call center operation, managing the center efficiently and 
 effectively, and establishing an extensive, well-planned training program is to meet corporate objectives for customer 
 service and to support the organization's overall CRM strategy. To accomplish these objectives, there are two 
 important requirements, which apply to every call center operation in every business sector. These are summarized 
 next.",NA
Meet customer needs ,"Meet the needs of the customer by following these 
 guidelines:
  
  
 ●     
 Fully identify the caller's need or problem.
  
 ●     
 Take ownership of the call-if possible, resolve the caller's need during the call itself.
  
 ●     
 Complete all steps to call resolution before taking another call.
  
 ●     
 For items that take longer than five minutes but are not a high priority, handle during a lower call volume 
 period, but before the end of the day.",NA
Meet business requirements ,"Satisfy the needs of the business by adhering to these criteria:
  
  
 ●     
 Thorough and efficient follow-up after calls
  
  
 ●     
 Updating all information

 Understanding the goals and mission statement and applying that understanding to every

Call Center Case Studies,NA,NA
Overview ,"This chapter presents a broad range of international call center case studies selected from both the public and 
 private sectors. These case studies illustrate how one or more of the following processes are used by organizations 
 to enhance productivity and maintain effective customer relationships: Managing their respective call centers, 
 applying best-practice human resource policies, using appropriate technologies, and implementing vendor 
 resources. For every case study, the term 
 call center
  may also mean 
 customer contact center.
  
 The case studies are presented in a traditional business school format, beginning with a brief corporate profile, the 
 challenge for the call center, a description of the call center operation, the technologies and vendor resources used, 
 where applicable, and the benefits achieved. The amount of detail in each case study varies and is based on the 
 amount of information available from each organization.
  
 Businesses in a number of industry sectors as well as government organizations at all levels have either established 
 new centers or expanded existing call center operations over the last several years. These have either been in-
 house centers or one of the outsourcing organizations listed in 
 Appendix A
 , ""Call Center Vendor Resources,"" or 
 carrier organizations that recognize this business as an adjunct to their main communications business. The 25 
 organizations selected from around the world for these case studies have successfully implemented or upgraded 
 call center operations and have demonstrated this success by meeting recognized industry criteria of service levels, 
 reduced staff turnover, enhanced profitability, and a high level of customer satisfaction. The following sectors and

 peak call times, call duration, and agent workload. The system can then predict what will happen when advertising 
 campaigns run and how exceptions such as these will affect the day-to-day operation of the contact center. The aim 
 is a fairly simple one: increase the volume of calls handled without employing more agents and maintain the service 
 level at 80% of calls answered within 20 seconds.",NA

5.5 Health care,NA,NA
Company: Delta Dental Plan of Kentucky,NA,NA
Profile,"The company manages dental plans for a broad range of client companies. In just a few months, Delta's 
 customer service call center dramatically improved productivity by changing its call center performance metrics.",NA
Solution,"The company decided to revamp its use of existing technology, implement a stricter schedule-adherence policy, and 
 introduce new incentive, quality, and team-building programs for its CSRs.
  
 The first task for the call center's manager of customer service was to review how calls were handled. The 10-agent 
 center takes about 30,000 calls monthly from plan providers, members, group administrators, and insurance brokers 
 and agents. Initially, callers enter an interactive voice response unit where they can get automated information, such 
 as the status of their claims. If they opt out of the automated system, the center's ACD routes the calls to CSRs.
  
 One of the problems with the manner in which the center was handling calls was that CSRs were making decisions 
 themselves as to how much time they needed to spend on after-call work. Calls were routed from the IVR to the 
 CSR's phones, but each agent could decide when to answer these calls. The solution was to change CSR priorities.
  
 A stricter schedule-adherence policy was introduced, requiring all CSRs to work on seven-and-a-half-hour shifts and 
 be available 95% of that time. As well, a tiered structure for routing calls through the ACD was introduced.",NA
Benefits,"Specific benefits that were realized include the following:
  
 ●     
 The average speed of answer dropped from more than 200 seconds to less than 20 seconds.
  
 ●     
 Call abandonment, previously more than 12%, virtually disappeared, to less than 2%.
  
 ●     
 Long-distance costs dropped by 20%, in spite of a 10% increase in call volume.
  
 ●     
 Fewer angry callers meant agents were less stressed, which has improved overall morale.
  
 ●     
 Formal performance-based programs for both individuals and teams were organized, with appropriate 
 awards ranging from gift certificates and gift baskets to time off.
  
 ●     
 Call-handling and off-work time were scheduled more efficiently, and a formal call-quality program was 
 established to ensure continuous top performance.",NA

5.6 Real estate,NA,NA
Company: Oxford Properties Group,NA,NA
Profile,"Oxford Properties operates an extensive building maintenance organization that services over 25 million square feet 
 of premium office space across Canada.",NA
Challenge,"Good tenant relations is a key to success in the real estate business. The extent of Oxford's real estate holdings 
 required its maintenance staff to respond to building maintenance requests quickly and efficiently. A recent tenant 
 satisfaction survey indicated there was room for improvement in the following areas: ease of contact, response 
 times, and satisfaction with problem resolutions.",NA
Solution,"To provide the best possible service experience for their tenants, Oxford's management team identified three primary 
 objectives:
  
 ●     
 Eliminate confusion by consolidating three regional centers into a single, multichannel center
  
 ●     
 Adopt a service level commitment for the contact center to answer 90% of calls within 10 seconds.
  
 ●     
 Establish a target of having a service person on site within 30 minutes 95% of the time.
  
 To realize these goals—and to ensure that their building maintenance group was a positive asset that would 
 strengthen tenant loyalty—Oxford selected Bell Canada's call center project management resources to assist its 
 internal team in designing an innovative program, called 310-MAXX, to manage the 30-minute service mandate 
 on orders coming into its building maintenance organization.
  
 With the 310-MAXX program, Oxford tenants simply make a service request call to 310-MAXX from anywhere in 
 Canada or log on to Oxford's building maintenance Website. To turn their vision into reality, Oxford Properties also 
 partnered with Bell Contact Centre Solutions to assist in the start-up and management of the contact center.
  
 The first phase focused on preparing the new, centralized, multichannel facility to handle the increased traffic. 
 This included adding or upgrading the following elements:

Challenge,"For a contact center such as Bargain Network, customer service is top priority. With a call volume of 12,000 calls 
 per day, supervisors understand the need to monitor, record, and store all communications between agent and 
 customer for both liability and quality assurance. The company had been recording critical communications using 
 simple cassette tapes and off-the-shelf tape recorders. As the business grew, the quality of the recording and

Challenge,"When HSN's two contact centers became too busy at peak times, a percentage of calls were routed to a third-party 
 provider. This percentage could only be changed every 15 minutes, which meant that agents in HSN's contact 
 centers could be idle while the calls were still being routed to the third party. As well, HSN elected to route calls from 
 frequent customers to a specific CSR to strengthen relationships and loyalty.",NA
Solution,"To resolve this situation with the third-party provider, HSN installed a load-balancing system for multiple call center 
 sites. Routing calls to a specific CSR was accomplished by using intelligent voice recognition (IVR) and an analysis

Challenge,"Because Crystal Decisions supports everything from shrink-wrapped customer products that sell for less than $200 
 to multimillion-dollar corporate installations, the company needed to find a way to support customers across this 
 broad spectrum consistently. A key requirement was to identify customers who had basic 60-day free support and 
 high-end customers who were paying for premium customer service.
  
 Supervisors were especially challenged. The closest thing the company had to real-time information was a periodic 
 recycling of the message reader board. Crystal Decisions had 14 queues, so 14 message boards were downloaded 
 to the network and flashed every minute. With contact center offices operating from Vancouver, Florida, Texas, 
 Australia, and the United Kingdom, an enterprisewide interaction management solution became a critical requirement 
 for a seamless information flow regardless of media type or physical location.",NA
Solution,"After careful evaluation of a half-dozen vendors, Crystal Decisions chose LGS Group and its Interaction Management 
 Solutions (IMS) system to deliver the Apropos Multimedia Interaction Management Solution. The IMS solution 
 emphasized ""agent empowerment."" The capability of Apropos to display all interactions and allow agents to select 
 those calls that took priority, had been waiting longest, or fell into a specialty area helped them be prepared and 
 proactive when answering a call. A caller preview function allowed agents to see caller information while calls are still 
 in the queue. In addition, integration with the corporate customer relationship management (CRM) database provided 
 a screen pop of the customer's data on the legacy system. Agents had immediate access to customers' detailed 
 records, providing consistent and effective support to every customer.
  
 When customers call, they are asked to enter their product registration number and/or call incident number. Calls are 
 routed based on these numbers. If customers have a valid support contract or are entitled to 60-day free support, 
 they are identified and, based on their support contract, placed in the appropriate queue. This important functions 
 allows Crystal Decisions to recover lost revenue by segmenting clients into those who have 60-day free software 
 support or those whose contract has expired.",NA

Solution,"Taking into consideration the requirements they were looking for in a contact center solution, Primavera chose 
 Apropos Technology's Multi-Channel Interaction Management Suite to manage phone and Web customer 
 interactions. The Apropos Intelligent Call Distribution (ICD) system gave Primavera more control over call routing, 
 distributing customer calls to the most appropriate agent in a quicker and more efficient fashion. Primavera also 
 gained improved real-time visibility and more in-depth historical reporting functionality to better manage both of the 
 company's contact centers with the Apropos solution.
  
 Primavera uses the Apropos solution to manage inbound customer interactions within the contact center and to 
 integrate with its existing Onyx customer database through Touch-Tone inputs into the interactive voice response 
 (IVR) unit, without changing any hardware or software configurations. The flexibility and customization of the solution 
 allows Primavera to service its customers based on individual needs. It allows CSRs to provide a high degree of 
 relationship-based service through the ability to view incoming and outgoing customer interaction requests based on 
 the interactions's priority or Primavera's specific business rules. Using these business rules also allows calls to be 
 routed to the most appropriate agent and interactions to be managed on a priority basis.
  
 In addition to handling interaction workflow, Apropos provides Primavera's contact center with a single point of 
 management for systemwide agent, supervisor, and server configurations. The Apropos solution also enables 
 Primavera to seamlessly manage all voice and Web customer interactions. Primavera's on-line customers have the

Chapter 6: ,NA,NA
Building Customer Relationships with Call Centers,NA,NA
Overview,"Customer relationship management (CRM) has been defined as a corporate wide approach to understanding 
 customer behavior, influencing it through continuous relevant communication, and developing long-term relationships 
 to enhance customer loyalty, acquisition, retention, and profitability. This chapter describes the importance of the 
 interrelationships between call/contact centers and the stages of developing and implementing a CRM strategy. The 
 center is the first point of customer contact and is therefore the first entree to establishing and maintaining long-term 
 customer relationships.
  
 CRM is often perceived by senior management with mixed feelings-on the one hand, it is a great opportunity to 
 enhance customer relationships and to increase revenues and profitability at the same time, and on the other hand, 
 it is a costly and time-consuming process that will alter fundamentally the corporate culture. CRM is also fraught 
 with the numerous potential pitfalls that confront any major corporate project involving people, processes, and 
 technologies. Aligning the vagaries of operating a call center with CRM poses some serious challenges for 
 corporate executives. CRM is not a technology or even a group of technologies; it is a continually evolving process 
 that requires a shift in attitude away from the traditional internal focus of a business and defines the approach a 
 company takes toward its customers, backed up by a thoughtful investment in people, technology, and business 
 processes.
  
 CRM is a logical step in the series of major commercial and IT initiatives that have been implemented since the 
 1980s, beginning with downsizing. Most of these early initiatives had a cost-cutting focus on the internal workings of 
 the business, concentrating on employees, working methods, or technology. Increased profitability was the desired 
 result, which was to be engineered through cost savings. All of these initiatives were based on decreasing costs 
 through increasing efficiency, which is one of the key benefits of a successful CRM strategy in addition to its 
 significant impact on the customer.",NA
6.1 A rationale and methodology for CRM,"Corporations large and small, from Old Economy to New, have been confronted with the dire predictions of software 
 companies and consultants pointing out that if their organizations did not jump on the CRM bandwagon, they would 
 be ground into the dust by competitors who were more aggressive and open to new corporate practices. CRM, 
 although a powerful tool in both the business-to-business and business-to-consumer environments, has been, 
 however, both oversold and underutilized. In many cases, more has been promised from CRM than it could possibly 
 deliver; and in other cases, companies have not properly planned or implemented CRM strategies and 
 consequently have failed to achieve its benefits.
  
 Some CRM vendors and consultants focus on CRM as a transorganizational strategy, one that must be rapidly 
 implemented and that required immediate commitment throughout the organization. However, the CRM process is 
 more readily accepted by organizations if the process is a gradual one that evolves from a series of data marts to an 
 enterprisewide data warehouse and CRM solution. This type of CRM development process has proven much easier 
 for organizations to manage and accept, and in the long run, it will pay dividends in enhanced customer relationships. 
 When CRM is seen only as a corporate strategy that must permeate all aspects of an organization's activities 
 immediately to be effective, there is a natural tendency to want to roll it out all at once in what has been called the 
 ""big bang"" approach. Too often, the big bang turns out to be a big bust! Organizations confronted with more corporate 
 changes than they can handle all at once may find the challenges faced by employees exceed the challenges faced 
 by the software. Because of the complex nature of even a modest CRM program, successful CRM implementation 
 requires above-average consulting services. Vendors tend to want to solve all the problems at once, and, although 
 consultants can assist in analyzing a business and its processes, there are more issues to be considered, addressed, 
 and resolved. It is important to devise a plan, implement it, and make it stick.",NA
Planning,"Companies should not be expending precious financial and human resources on particular communications channels 
 and customer segments out of all proportion to their profitability and practicality. The key is to define a customer 
 service strategy by determining investment priorities and then to select the best supportive technology. Making the 
 proper choice of technologies is critical, but this can only be accomplished with a coherent, executable plan. Often, 
 companies are expected to ""go live"" with salesforce automation, customer service, and marketing all at once. As 
 noted, this approach has resulted in the failure of CRM strategies and, more importantly, a loss of confidence in CRM 
 itself.
  
 Rather than going with the ""big bang,"" knowledgeable consultants advise going deep, not broad. Using a gradual 
 approach, a company identifies the most important application of CRM and ensures that this implementation is 
 successful before moving on to the next one. It is better to identify specific customer segments and 
 communications channels for the initial execution and focus on doing this aspect well before tackling the next 
 segments and channels. CRM tends to overwhelm organizations with its expanding variety of communication 
 channels. Just because one lone customer wants to send a company a wireless e-mail from a data-equipped cell 
 phone to order a replacement burner for a barbecue is no reason for an organization to be prepared to 
 accommodate the order. This could be viewed as carrying customer relations to their illogical conclusion!",NA
Making it work,"The business processes must be mapped into the underlying technology. Customers are supported by the way 
 organizations work; the technology provides that support. Technology itself should not be in the driver's seat. 
 Companies frequently buy CRM technology in the name of customer service and then forget about the customer—
 implementing the application becomes an internal issue in which the main reason for the implementation in the 
 first place gets lost in the process. The focus must be on the customer at all times.",NA
Making it stick,"For CRM to have long-term practicality and benefits, an organization has to believe in its underlying proposition of 
 improving customer relations. It is more than software and digital switching systems, in the same way that these 
 elements alone do not make a successful call center. A customer-focused mindset must take root in the organization, 
 and this takes time. Ideally, the change in focus should begin well before the CRM technology is rolled out. 
 Employees need to develop the skillsets to serve customers better; senior executives need to show the type of 
 leadership that encourages a customer-centric culture. People need incentives to believe in CRM.",NA
Integration,"Software-driven CRM systems integrate front-office activities such as sales, customer service, and technical support 
 with back-office resources such as accounting and inventory management. Only a few years ago, many organizations 
 considered CRM to be a call center with rows full of customer service representatives working telephones in front of 
 computer monitors. An explosion in communication channels, particularly through the Internet, means that call 
 centers have become multichannel components of CRM strategy with the capability to address and integrate 
 telephones, Web presence, e-mail, real-time text chat, and wireless data. As product offerings for this new capability 
 became more complex, they became more difficult to implement. In fact, CRM's scope has become so ambitious that 
 there are serious doubts any one vendor can deliver a product that performs as promised. A single-vendor product 
 may soon be within reach, but the most important factor in CRM success is not what is installed, but 
 how
 .
  
 Some organizations have invested millions of dollars and thousands of hours over long periods of time to deploy and 
 integrate corporate applications—salesforce automation (SFA), help desk, enterprise resource planning (ERP), 
 marketing automation, e-commerce, call/contact centers, and Web platforms—to implement and support CRM 
 strategies that build customer loyalty through intelligent and trusted communication. Using innovative technologies to 
 achieve this goal while containing costs is a fundamental challenge for every company that embraces CRM. For 
 many organizations that adhered to the old ways of doing business, the move to a CRM strategy began with the 
 realization that the customer, the market, and the competition had changed and would continue to change. Treating 
 customers as ""mass markets"" is no longer a viable business strategy, and success in business in the 21st century 
 requires a new vision, a vision that demands changes in the processes, people, and practices with which the 
 customer is involved. The reason is that as businesses merged and grew, customer bases grew and the customer 
 changed along the way. Armed with their newfound understanding of the levels of service that suppliers can and 
 should provide, customers expect much more. And the power they wield in the marketplace can only increase with 
 time. Organizations following the old ways of doing business have a greater challenge and will require a few years 
 and major changes in corporate culture to evolve a successful CRM strategy. (see 
 Figure 6.1
 ) Other organizations 
 that have continually examined and revised their methods 
  
 of relating to customers, as well as adopted appropriate technologies along the way, have a relatively short route 
 to follow in evolving a formal CRM strategy. Only a fine-tuning of existing processes, a refinement of current 
 technologies, and additional training of staff may be required to ensure the transition to a complete CRM solution.

 Sources of customer information.",NA
6.2 Strategies for managing customer information,"Large organizations routinely collect vast amounts of personal information about their customers through the 
 transactions they conduct. Organizations such as financial institutions, health care providers, travel agencies, 
 retailers, automotive manufacturers, and communication companies, among others, use this data in a variety of 
 ways and for several reasons:
  
 ●     
 For targeted marketing based on individual preferences
  
 ●     
 To analyze customers for profitability
  
 ●     
 To evaluate their own service levels
  
 Simply gathering information and storing it will not produce measurable business results; many CRM strategies have 
 failed to achieve objectives because of difficulties in developing a strong understanding of 
 who customers are and 
 what they really want
  and applying this knowledge to customer relationship strategies and processes. (see 
 Figure 
 6.2
 ) Some companies build large multiterabyte (1000 
  
 gigabytes equals 1 terabyte) data warehouses to crunch information about their customers in an effort to 
 determine their buying habits or product preferences. Oftentimes, correlating customer purchasing habits is not 
 properly done-just because data can be correlated doesn't mean the relationship between one set of data and 
 another is significant from a business viewpoint. Obviously, technology and business processes must be applied in 
 a logical context to ensure that customer data are applied in a way to meet CRM objectives. (see 
 Figure 6.3
 )

 Enhancing customer service with technology.",NA
6.3 Technology and business tools to support CRM,"It is important to choose the right technology tools to support CRM. Direct and indirect supporting technologies 
 include:
  
 ●     
 Data warehousing
  
 ●     
 Data mining
  
 ●     
 Database systems
  
 ●     
 Wireless communication
  
 ●     
 Voice-over IP
  
 ●     
 E-mail-based Internet communications
  
 These tools have evolved to the point that they have made available many more channels for customer interaction 
 and sources of data, all of which impact the call/contact center. Business tools that support CRM include:
  
 ●     
 Customer contact software
  
 ●     
 Marketing campaign programs
  
 ●     
 Channel integration
  
 ●     
 Product literature
  
 Where legacy systems exist, the acquisition of ""
 middleware
 "" may be required in order to interface the legacy systems 
 with the CRM 
  
 solutions. The key challenge for the CRM project team is to select a series of tools that fit the needs of the business, 
 to evaluate these tools, and to select the best ones. The IT department plays a very prominent role in this selection 
 process and in the development, implementation, and support of a CRM solution and its integration with the 
 call/contact center. The various technology tools involved should be seamlessly integrated into the IT environment. 
 This aspect of a CRM strategy requires a formal plan to manage the selection of the tools—from data warehouse and 
 database software to the business applications and processes.",NA
CRM and the new marketing paradigm,"CRM has several definitions within the industry, but one short definition best describes the process and the 
 objectives: 
 ""the capability of an organization to evolve from a mass marketing model of millions to a market of one,""
  
 that is, dealing with customers as 
 if they were the only customer
 . This is a new way of thinking for many companies in 
 virtually every business sector where customers often number in the thousands or millions. Managing customer 
 relationships successfully in these large customer environments means learning about their habits and needs, 
 anticipating future buying patterns, and finding new marketing opportunities that add value to the relationship. It also 
 means using technologies that enable the data gathered to be useful in making better business decisions that will 
 attract, retain, or motivate customers.
  
 Successful companies make their customer relationships something the customer values more than anything else 
 they could receive from the competition. How do companies do this? By examining their experiences with customers, 
 including transactions and demographics, and every form of interaction—including a Website visit, a phone call to a 
 call center, and a response from a direct mail campaign. Building the data and information technology architecture 
 around customers—a 
 customer-centric
  approach—ensures that they enjoy a seamless and rewarding experience 
 when doing business with a company. This new marketing paradigm places the customer at the focal point of an 
 organization's marketing programs.",NA
Key elements,"The two following key elements will ensure the success of a CRM strategy and meet the objectives of the 
 organization to develop long-term customer relationships:",NA
Customer knowledge through CRM,"A successful CRM strategy can provide answers to many questions that every organization typically has about its 
 customers: (see 
 Figure 6.7
 )",NA
Customer data ,"One of the common problems many organizations share is integrating customer information. When information is 
 disparate and fragmented, it is difficult to know who the customers are and the nature of their associations or 
 relationships. This also makes it difficult to capitalize on opportunities to increase customer service, loyalty, and 
 profitability. For example, knowing that other family members are also customers provides an opportunity to upsell or 
 cross sell products or services, or knowing that a customer uses several sources of interaction with a supplier may 
 also provide opportunities to enhance the relationship.
  
 In building toward a CRM solution, the organization must analyze how well it is aligned to deliver the following core 
 capabilities:
  
 ●     
 Customer value management
  
  
 ●     
 Prospecting
  
  
 ●     
 Selling
  
  
 ●     
 Collection and use of customer intelligence
  
  
 ●     
 Customer development (upselling and cross selling)
  
  
 ●     
 Customer service and retention",NA
Shifting from a product focus to a customer-centric focus,"In the e-commerce business world, a customer can switch to a competitor's product with a click or two on a Web 
 page. A customer-centric focus—the best means of building lasting customer relationships in both the traditional and 
 new ways of doing business—has become absolutely imperative in the new business economy, but shifting to a 
 customer-centric approach is not a straightforward process, nor is it a natural one. The reason for this is that, in 
 general, businesses are launched on the basis of a unique product or service. Initially, the focus is on building that 
 product or developing that service and informing the marketplace of its availability and desirability. When another 
 company eventually begins producing and marketing a similar product, the original company loses its competitive 
 edge.
  
 At this point, companies adopt other strategies to regain the competitive edge they had when they had a unique 
 product or service. They begin streamlining operations to produce the product better, faster, and cheaper. But 
 improved performance is a short-lived advantage because the competition inevitably applies the same strategy, 
 resulting in a leap-frogging process common to many business sectors. Customer relationships then become more 
 important than simply building a good product or delivering good service. Building good products is often easier than 
 building good customer relationships, and although product quality is still important, it is no longer the key to",NA
Customer value,"Transforming 
 customer knowledge
  into 
 customer value
  can create a significant competitive advantage. For example, 
 when high-value customers are identified and their needs anticipated, new value is created for them where it did not 
 exist before. Ultimately, customer-centric organizations build customer loyalty, a customer response characteristic 
 that leads to higher profitability. There are several ways organizations can categorize customers by their ""value."" 
 Tracking revenues, cost, and profitability is not the only way to assess customer value. Another, more advanced 
 method of evaluating customer value is by assessing their 
 value potential
 , which has been defined as the willingness 
 of customers to participate in the creation of products and services, sharing with them information and other 
 resources and sharing control over the design and production of products and services.",NA
6.4 The CRM planning phase,"As noted previously, CRM is not an event, but a process that is evolutionary in nature and that requires a road 
 map to guide organizations through the many alternative routes that could be taken. Following that road map 
 involves a concerted effort from several organizational components: people, processes, culture, and technology.
  
 An overview of the CRM planning phase will assist call center personnel to understand the complexity of 
 developing a corporate CRM strategy, and give them some insight into the call center role.
  
 There are four key elements in the development of a CRM road map, and they need to be approached in the 
 following order:
  
  
 ●     
 Analyzing the current state of customer interactions
  
  
 ●     
 Predicting the future course of customer interactions
  
  
 ●     
 Developing the Plan of Action to meet the predicted future course
  
  
 ●     
 Building and presenting the business case to secure CRM project funding 
  
 Analyzing the current state of customer interactions and associated historical customer data will determine where the 
 enterprise is along the path to its CRM objectives. Examples of questions about current customer relations that need 
 to be answered are: Does the organization 
 track and manage
  each customer as a single entity or do individual sales 
 offices maintain their own set of customer records? Is customer database information 
 accurate
  and 
 up-to-date
 ? An 
 early assessment of these elements of the business operation will highlight customer administration procedures that 
 may need to be changed to take advantage of the new CRM strategy. (see 
 Figure 6.10
 )
  
  
 Figure 6.10: 
 Accessing detailed customer information.",NA
The CRM plan of action ,"One of the first requirements for the CRM Plan of Action is establishing priorities of functionality, which breaks the 
 CRM development process down into two phases: establishing a list of essential features and developing a list of 
 optional features. This approach to planning—adding functionality in a modular way—is consistent with the modular 
 approach adopted by many CRM hardware and software vendors. Taking a building-block approach to incorporating 
 functionality will also assist in developing the CRM Plan of Action and in the subsequent design and deployment of 
 the CRM solution.
  
 The following organizational elements must be included in the CRM 
 Plan of Action:
 ●     
 Call/contact center management
  
 ●     
 The IT department",NA
Selecting the technology solutions,"As noted previously, many enterprises believe that a large-scale CRM technology deployment is the only solution to 
 their problems. However, the right technological enablers for an organization are those that 
 solve the organization's 
 business problems
  as they are identified during the CRM planning stage. Some of the solutions may be
  
 ●     
 Improving call center telephony infrastructure
  
 ●     
 Enabling customer/contact center calls over the Web
  
 ●     
 Deploying or enhancing data warehouse or data mart information to collect and analyze customer and market 
 data
  
 ●     
 Improving customer relationships through customer-facing e-business
  
 During the evolution of CRM over the past several years, a number of CRM projects failed to deliver projected 
 results because companies seized on technology as an immediate solution to enhanced customer relations rather 
 than modify their corporate culture. In those organizations that took the ""technology is the key"" route to CRM and 
 were unable to devise a successful CRM strategy, the people, the support systems, and the processes—including 
 the corporate culture—were not ready to manage the new technology and to apply proven principles of CRM to their 
 day-to-day operations.
  
 Technology is a significant element in the CRM mix; however, selecting the best enabling technologies for CRM 
 solutions must be based on solid business practices and readiness to implement. Selection of both tools and 
 vendors, is a critical process, but goals and metrics must be established to measure the effect of the tools.",NA
Changing the focus,"In the past, large and small organizations have not needed to formalize their customer relationships by means 
 of a definable customer strategy to achieve successful relations with their customers. In the new era, in which 
 the customer reigns supreme, businesses must change their focus to ensure that customer relationship 
 practices 
 maximize
  customer benefit.
  
 When a business knows its customers and targets its communications to their specific interests and shopping 
 behaviors, the result is increased revenues and loyal, long-term customers. This is the power of 
 one-to-one CRM
 . If 
 the CRM strategy does not focus on individual customer's transactions, both in the process of segmentation and in 
 the contact strategy, it will not be successful. Tracking the transactional details of a customer's purchase allows the 
 most effective communication possible. With CRM, the benefit of the commercial relationship with each individual 
 customer can be maximized. Today, based on practices that evolved in the retail industry, every business can, for",NA
6.5 A 12-stage CRM strategy,"In the experience of many organizations, CRM is a powerful growth strategy capable of producing significant benefits 
 and transforming both organizations and industries. However, for every company that has achieved dramatic 
 success, there are many others that are still struggling to realize the full potential of their customer-driven growth 
 strategies. For these latter organizations, the path of implementation has been filled with obstacles and the pace of 
 implementation has been far slower and more frustrating than anticipated.
  
 The lessons learned by others and the methodologies and technologies available can be used by any organization to 
 make the change from a product or service orientation to a customer-focused orientation that provides strong returns 
 on the CRM investment in a matter of months rather than years. The 
 12-stage CRM strategy
  outlined in this section is 
 a proven methodology for resolving many issues in a logical, efficient manner. Although no two companies can follow 
 precisely the same implementation path, the stages defined here need to be a part of the process, and most of them 
 can be carried out simultaneously. Some organizations will already have moved through some of these stages; 
 others will need to start at the beginning. The following paragraphs describe in detail the activities involved in each 
 stage and the significance of each of the 12 stages.
  
 12-Stage CRM Strategy
  
 1.  Develop a clear set of business objectives.
  
 2.  Formulate a detailed Plan of Action.
  
 3.  Provide strong leadership.
  
 4.  Institute changes in corporate culture.
  
 5.  Obtain support of a senior management member.
  
 6.  Build in stages, starting with the most crucial area.
  
 7.  Create an integrated business design.

 10.  Encourage the development of organizational capabilities in team members.
  
 11.  Generate early ""wins"" to create a self-funding process.
  
 12.  Include customers in a two-way flow of communication.",NA
Develop a clear set of business objectives,"Defining clear business objectives is an obvious first step in any project, major or minor. However, because of the 
 evolutionary nature of a CRM strategy and the involvement of so many areas of an organization, it is extremely 
 important to establish business objectives that will create a competitive advantage and guide the overall 
 implementation process. These objectives should relate to the fundamental concept behind a CRM solution.
  
 The business case prepared to convince senior management of the benefits of CRM should be firmly and logically 
 based on overall corporate objectives-perhaps the corporate mission statement, if one exists. It should include 
 information about direct competitors and how the system supports corporate strategies, plus the expected qualitative 
 and quantitative benefits. As mentioned earlier, improving customer satisfaction and creating a base of more loyal 
 customers will have both qualitative and quantitative benefits-more sales per customer, lower cost of sales, 
 incremental sales via referrals, and ultimately more profits. Some of these benefits may be intangible, but collectively, 
 they are powerful reasons to support CRM.",NA
Formulate a detailed plan of action,file:///D|/1/5959final/LiB0050.html (1 von 4) [20.09.2007 19:03:36],NA
Provide strong leadership,"For any major project, sound leadership is a prerequisite; therefore, the people selected as team or project leaders 
 need to have leadership attributes that will keep the project and the project staff on track. A balance between 
 business and technology backgrounds is preferable for leadership candidates-knowledge in both areas will assist at 
 all stages of the process.",NA
Institute changes in corporate culture,"At the heart of CRM strategies is changing fundamentally the decision-making process within the company. 
 Rigorous data analysis is replacing business instinct as a basis for both day-to-day decision making and strategic 
 planning. Other changes in the corporate culture may also be required.",NA
Obtain support of a senior management member,"The success of every CRM project will depend on several factors and the effective integration of all stages; however, 
 the support the project receives internally is of particular value. The support of a senior management member-for 
 example, the vice president of marketing or sales, vice president of finance, or other member of the senior 
 management team-is crucial to the success of the CRM strategy. The importance of this stage of the process cannot 
 be overemphasized. The designated senior management person must be an integral part of the CRM team and 
 committed to attending and actively participating in all project meetings and workshops.",NA
"Build in stages, starting with the most crucial areas","The first stage of development should focus on the operations and technology needed to implement a top-priority set 
 of CRM business objectives, as identified in Stage 1. Typically, the first stage of development can become 
 operational in two to four months, and at a small fraction of the costs that have traditionally been incurred for new 
 systems. Many companies use the first stage to establish a 
 ""proof of concept,""
  to demonstrate to management that 
 CRM really works, and then follow up with subsequent stages to scale up the operations and technology as well as to 
 expand the scope of the overall program.",NA
Create an integrated business design,NA,NA
Develop a customer-driven product and service development process,"Product-driven companies have a tradition of building products based on instincts and engineering requirements 
 rather than on customer requirements. Even when these companies agree that an ""outside-in,"" customer-driven 
 process could remove much of the risk of product development, they may not make the transition easily. A 
 significant step forward in becoming customer driven is establishing a process for monitoring customer purchase 
 rates and then using the value proposition to quickly identify the changes in customer behavior that signal a need 
 for revitalization and new development. It is not necessary to dismantle or even radically change the product 
 development component of an organization. The strengths of that component need to be preserved while 
 integrating a stream of customer input. The objective is to establish a dynamic product and service development 
 process that can adapt as quickly as the marketplace can change.",NA
Concentrate on activities that create economic value,"Often, the transition to CRM strategies requires new skills and organizational processes. An ideal way to learn is to 
 learn through action
 , that is, by applying new practices and processes guided by experienced leaders. This ""rapid 
 deployment"" methodology enables companies to immediately launch a range of sophisticated customer programs by 
 relying on the resourcefulness of their own staff and, to the extent needed, guidance from experienced consultants. 
 To optimize results, the work should be carried out by cross-functional teams that are unified under a shared set of 
 objectives. In addition, the teams should be focused on using innovative methodologies and, most importantly, should 
 be committed to producing 
 tangible, measurable results
 .
  
 A ""test and learn"" process is becoming a basic requirement for CRM success. This process is much more than a 
 measurement system. It is a way of doing business. Its foundation should be a rigorous test- and control-based 
 measurement system that is integrated with customer initiatives and other areas of investment to measure business 
 outcomes in a systematic way. A key metric should be 
 impact on customer value
 . In addition, the process should 
 include regular review sessions that bring together senior management, analysts, and key operating staff to plan 
 refinements and steer the business based on both internal and external (customer) feedback.",NA
Encourage the development of organizational abilities in team members,"It is no longer necessary for companies to spend millions of dollars and years of effort before producing measurable 
 returns from CRM. Compelling returns can be generated within months of the launch, which in turn helps to build 
 valuable momentum. Companies in many industries have consistently realized dramatic gains that provide a proof 
 of concept in the early stages of CRM development. These gains also become the basis for developing economic 
 projections, and in some cases, they provide a self-funding, self-sustaining mechanism for the CRM strategy. The 
 examples in the sidebar illustrate the magnitude of gains realized from the first CRM programs launched by 
 companies in various business sectors under their new CRM strategies.

Include customers in a two-way flow of communication,"Customer information has become a major strategic asset for businesses, creating requirements for information 
 management and control that are just as important as those for managing an organization's finances. An 
 advanced information control capability requires the significant involvement of the call/contact center and should 
 integrate two major components of CRM:
  
 ●     
 Managing customer contacts
 -an active control process for information exchange with customers
  
 ●     
 Managing customer knowledge
 -a control process for the retention of information and accessibility
  
 Radical changes in the marketplace, as emphasized throughout this book, mean that it is no longer sufficient to 
 conduct periodic surveys to monitor changes in the marketplace. The marketplace changes daily and customer 
 expectations can change significantly and quickly, often because of aggressive competition. The continuous and 
 systematic capture, retention, and analysis of customer information, from virtually every point of customer contact, is 
 an essential activity in a successful CRM strategy.
  
 Major advances in contact management software are being made to support ongoing information exchange 
 between a company and its customers and for seamless integration of multichannel communications with 
 customers. There are several important sources of customer information:
  
 ●     
 Customer contact channels,
  including call centers, retail outlets, and e-commerce Websites
  
 ●     
 Transaction systems
  for detailed customer behavioral data
  
 ●     
 Outbound marketing programs

 ●     
 Secondary data sources
  such as credit data and compiled demographic and lifestyle data
  
 ●     
 Market research
  for insights beyond those revealed by actual customer behavior and dialogue
  
 When properly integrated into the CRM framework, these information sources provide a continuing stream of 
 updates from customers that enables companies to respond quickly to their evolving needs and priorities. (see

 Eight areas of operational and customer-oriented capabilities in CRM.",NA
6.6 Applying the CRM strategy,"The goal of CRM is to evolve from a marketing model that was based on a product-centric marketing structure to 
 one based on dealing with each customer as if that customer were the only customer. Managing customer 
 relationships successfully means learning about the habits and needs of customers, anticipating future buying 
 patterns, and finding new opportunities to add value to the relationship.",NA
Customer behavior patterns,"In the financial sector, for example, banks-early beneficiaries of successful CRM strategies-are using data 
 warehousing and data mining technologies to learn to anticipate their customers' needs from the millions of 
 transactions and interactions they have with their customers. 
  
 The patterns of customer behavior and attitude derived from this information enable the banks to effectively 
 segment customers by predetermined criteria. Such detailed customer data can provide answers to the 
 following questions:
  
 ●     
 Which communication channel do customers prefer?
  
 ●     
 What would be the risk of their leaving the bank to go to the competition?
  
 ●     
 What is the probability the customer will buy a service or product?
  
 With this knowledge, the financial institution can develop marketing programs that relate logically and psychologically 
 to each customer segment, provide valuable customer information to the call/contact center, support cross selling and 
 customer-retention programs, and assist the staff to maximize the value of each customer's interaction.",NA
Maximizing individual customer experiences,"How does an organization manage each customer relationship individually? Several fundamental changes in 
 business functions can be made on the way to a complete CRM solution. Marketing departments need systems that 
 allow employees to track, capture, and analyze millions of customer activities, both interactions and transactions, 
 over a long period of time. This knowledge helps the organization to create promotions, develop new products and 
 services, and design communication programs that attract, reward, and retain customers. Two other fundamental 
 concepts behind a successful CRM strategy are operational and technological excellence. Attaining leadership in 
 these areas enables an organization to predict and maximize the value of each customer relationship.",NA
6.7 CRM issues and tactics,"Companies assessing a CRM strategy or in the process of implementation have many issues to consider. For 
 example:
  
 ●     
 Deciding how and where to start
  
 ●     
 Minimizing costs
  
 ●

 specific areas are given in the paragraphs that follow.",NA
CRM workshops,"Holding CRM workshops can be extremely valuable in bringing together management groups to establish an in-
 depth understanding of the concepts, methods, and implications of the new strategies as well as conveying a 
 common viewpoint. Senior management should play a prominent leadership role in this process by providing a 
 supporting member to the CRM project team, as noted earlier in Stage 5. It is also very important for senior 
 management to meet separately in the initial planning and objective-setting stages with key managers and groups 
 to establish an understanding of why the transition to CRM is needed as well as to examine the implications and 
 opportunities for each group's area of responsibility. The leadership role remains critical throughout the 
 implementation process, both to provide a compelling vision, driven by senior management, of where the company 
 is going and to instill a sense of urgency and commitment to the changes that are needed.",NA
Exact transaction analysis,"The next step in developing a CRM program retraces the retail sector's original roots, when neighborhood store 
 owners knew their customers and took special care to serve their interests and needs. The megastore and a 
 reduction in customer service came next. But now CRM technology is allowing retailers to rebuild customer 
 relationships and keep customers coming back, the same way the neighborhood store did in a bygone era. Over the 
 past decade, CRM has evolved from being a relatively small part of marketing operations at a few forward-thinking 
 retailers to becoming a core corporate strategy of many retail businesses as well as of businesses in other major 
 sectors. Customer purchase history and demographic information are now used not just in marketing programs, but in 
 every facet of a retail business, including real estate sales and acquisitions, store locations, e-commerce, and 
 merchandise selection. Despite its detractors and the failure of poorly designed and/or poorly implemented CRM 
 projects, there are numerous testimonials to the success of the effective application of CRM strategies in 
 organizations from every major business sector.
  
 As the term 
 exact transaction analysis
  implies, it is a process of analyzing every customer transaction exactly. It is the 
 ultimate method of deriving the full benefit of CRM, because CRM can only be successful if an organization has the 
 capability to interact with 
 each and every
  customer on an individual level. Only when a complete, one-on-one 
 relationship is achieved can an organization realize the goal of lifelong, profitable customer relationships. Access to 
 extremely detailed customer information, down to the level of individual transactions, is the key to the full realization 
 of CRM's potential.",NA
Relationship technologies,Four factors are key elements in the application of relationship technology to managing customer relationships:,NA
Privacy,"Another element of customer relationships that has become a significant issue in the consumer marketplace is 
 privacy of personal information
 . As organizations build large data warehouses of customer demographic and 
 transactional information, protecting the privacy of this information becomes very important in developing and 
 retaining customers and in fostering customer-centric relationships. In short, customers expect organizations to 
 respect their privacy. If they do not, customers can use their purchasing power to register their dissatisfaction, or in 
 some jurisdictions where there are legal statutes in place to protect privacy, they can resort to the law.",NA
A rationale for CRM,"Clearly, transforming customer information into customer value can create a significant competitive advantage. 
 High-value customers are identified, their needs anticipated, and new value created for them where it did not exist 
 before. The end result for a customer-centric organization is customer loyalty, which translates into higher 
 profitability. Product-centric values—delivering functionality and quality on time and on budget—should be 
 augmented, not replaced, by a CRM solution. In a customer-centric organization, the traditional product-centric 
 values become more meaningful when supported by effective CRM strategies.
  
 The importance of assessing the company's current capabilities and plotting the many dimensions of the business 
 along the continuum from product-centricity to customer-centricity cannot be overstressed. Comparing corporate 
 attributes with what is happening in the marketplace should also be a part of this assessment. This process will 
 enable the organization to benefit from the potential of CRM processes and technologies by building on an objective 
 assessment of the company's customer-oriented capabilities, based on a defined set of projects, including investment 
 estimates and business cases.",NA
6.8 Customer input to CRM,"Businesses can maximize the effectiveness of CRM systems in creating more intimate, intelligent, and profitable 
 customer relationships by using a new approach: giving customers control over a subset of the information stored in 
 CRM systems. A customer-directed layer in an existing CRM system allows the customer access to important, 
 account-specific information when, where, and for whatever reason the customer specifies. This further reinforces the 
 development of one-to-one relationships with customers, a major objective of CRM, as noted previously. By 
 incorporating a one-to-one approach, the CRM system can deliver actionable response options tuned precisely to a 
 customer profile and related specifically to a company's call/contact center infrastructure.
  
 An additional benefit in extending CRM systems to provide proactive outbound customer service from its call/contact 
 center and relevant inbound response options is that unnecessary inbound calls will be reduced and customer 
 satisfaction and revenue increased—without increasing staff. When customers are forced to place a call or e-mail to a 
 company about their account, they most likely have a problem with a product or service or require information. 
 Providing an outbound CRM resource helps save customers' time and effort, eliminating or reducing the voice mail 
 syndrome that has become a fact of everyday life. (see 
 Figure 6.12
 ) When a company proactively or preemptively 
  
 provides information that is relevant to and frequently requested by an individual customer—monthly account 
 balance, shipping status, itinerary changes, and so on—the company solidifies a positive, helpful image in the 
 customer's psyche. Customer surveys reflect the fact that consumers appreciate doing business with companies 
 that provide personalized attention and service.
  
  
 Figure 6.12: 
 Automated e-mail response process.",NA
The alert platform,"An 
 alert platform
  provides, as the name implies, an alerting mechanism that enables customers to communicate with 
 supplier companies about their products or services, for example, to place or change an order or to advise of 
 problems, defects, or other aspects of the supplier's product or service. To provide adequate coverage of 
 alert/response applications to the widest market, an alert platform must support a broad range of communication 
 media, including
  
 ●     
 High-quality voice via land-line telephone and cell phone
  
 ●     
 Properly formatted text and interactive applications for e-mail, pager, Internet, fax, and wireless devices
  
 Proactive communications from companies to customers need to be through their existing preferred communication 
 devices. Offering only one contact mode is not adequate for the media-diverse and mobile customer base that is 
 characteristic of today's marketplace. This is not to say, however, that the land-line telephone should be neglected. 
 Voice alerts governed by detailed customer preferences are mandatory in every system. Although the use of wireless 
 text devices and e-mail is rapidly accelerating, voice is and will be the dominant communications channel for 
 delivering timely alerts that require immediate response and interaction. An alert formatted for voice delivery reaches 
 the broadest audience and enables the business message to rise above the flood of e-mail. Voice formatting adds a 
 human quality and time-sensitive value to a message. Voice alerts are also the most conducive to eliciting a customer 
 response because of their familiarity and simplicity (""press 1 to speak with a customer service agent"" or ""press 2 to 
 buy""). Given the option, customers will select voice delivery for many of their alerts, and the responses associated 
 with these alerts will be higher than any other media.",NA
Implementing alert/response applications,"A sophisticated alert/response platform is the perfect companion to a company's existing call/contact center 
 systems to augment and integrate with the CRM system. The recent evolution of CRM to supporting outbound 
 customer contacts may mean that traditional CRM hardware and software cannot support the new applications, 
 however. The typical CRM system does not have the built-in capability to enable companies to anticipate customer 
 calls and to reach out to customers with information tailored specifically to them before they call.
  
 If a CRM system is capable of being integrated with alert technology, the alerts typically do not contain the 
 customized, deep-enterprise data that customers want. For example, they may offer only limited syndicated content 
 that is individually addressed and broadcast, making the alerts more like generic spam messages. Or, if the 
 information is deep and customer-specific, these systems typically support delivery via a single medium only, usually 
 e-mail. Moreover, those companies that have already made the initial foray into alert systems rarely table an 
 integrated approach to managing responses to alerts. There is a critical void when it comes to delivering customer-
 specific information in a variety of mediums, enabling intelligent two-way interaction, or making the most of a 
 company's existing data to serve customers better and successfully involve them in one-to-one outbound interactions.",NA
Integrating with existing systems,"Armed with their existing customer systems and the right outbound alert/response platform, companies can learn 
 from their customer interactions how to offer a continuously higher level of successful customer service, adding 
 customer input to enhance their CRM system. Existing customer contact systems need to be integrated with an 
 alert/response program. With a touch of the keypad or a click of the mouse, customers must be able to connect easily 
 to the business, talk to a live agent, transfer to an automated transaction system for purchasing, or add personal 
 comments and forward the alert to others who may be interested in the information.
  
 For customers to find alerts useful and to respond to them in a positive way, the alerts must be triggered on 
 detailed, account-specific information and governed by the preferences of each customer. The data that trigger 
 these alerts could be stored in a variety of different databases or even in multiple databases within the same 
 organization. XML, one of the newer computer languages and one that is rapidly becoming a developer preference, 
 can handle this problem. XML-based technology seamlessly integrates many disparate back-office, call/ contact 
 center, and database systems, including computer telephony integration (CTI), voice processing, collaboration, 
 legacy, CRM, and Web-oriented systems. An XML-based extraction platform is a powerful, flexible way to trigger 
 alerts.",NA
Configuring the alert/response content,"Alert content must be dynamic, easy to create, easy to manage, and appealing to the alert recipient. To maximize the 
 application and create the highest value for the customer, administrators must be able to change alert content and 
 create new alerts as business conditions change—via a packaged management solution, not via customer 
 development. Contact center management and nontechnical administrators need to be able to ""tune"" alert/response 
 systems on an application-by-application basis. The administration components should include the following:
  
 ●     
 Prerecorded voice content
  
 ●     
 Rules for conditional use of text-to-speech, retry frequency, and logic
  
 ●     
 Links between alert behavior and call center hours and real-time load
  
 Given these requirements, companies strapped for IT resources will look to vendors to provide graphical user 
 interfaces that incorporate easy-to-use, drag-and-drop alert development and maintenance.
  
 Preemptive alerting has both operational and strategic benefits for the business. It eliminates unnecessary, costly, 
 non-revenue-generating inbound customer contact, resulting in increased customer satisfaction, dramatic cost-per-
 call savings, call elimination, and better service levels, as well as a reduction in the number of agents required in call 
 centers. On a strategic level, proactively giving customers the information they want increases customer satisfaction 
 and gives companies a competitive advantage. In addition, offering alerts with intelligent response options enables 
 companies to combine sales and service initiatives that increase revenue, generate highly qualified inbound traffic,",NA
6.9 Managing the CRM program,"Management may be loosely defined as the art and science of getting from here to there. Most large organizations 
 have more than one CRM project touching many parts of the enterprise. And these projects are managed by many 
 different players, some in call centers, on Websites, or run by salesforces or different business groups. Pulling all this 
 activity together into an enterprisewide program is a major challenge. CRM program management guidelines offer a 
 sound approach to program and project management. Developing CRM program guidelines brings managers back 
 inside the enterprise to the starting point.",NA
Program manager guidelines,"The following guidelines provide an overview of the practical steps that can be taken to ensure that the CRM program 
 (or programs) will work at all levels, from strategy articulation to software installation and training. The goal of these 
 eight guidelines is to improve the success rate of CRM programs and to enable an organization to measure success 
 through clear linkages between program initiatives and desired business results. Each of the following eight steps 
 matches a phase of CRM program design and implementation:
  
 1.  
 Program diagnosis
  
 2.  
 Strategy review
  
 3.  
 Enterprise architecture
  
 4.  
 Enterprise application integration services
  
 5.  
 Package selection and implementation
  
 6.  
 Application outsourcing assessment
  
 7.  
 Implementation review
  
 8.  
 Program and project management
  
 Each step and its associated activities have been proven effective in previous large-scale change and 
 improvement programs, such as business process reengineering and enterprise resource planning (ERP). The 
 hard lessons learned in implementing these projects also apply to CRM programs.
  
 The eight steps recommended in the program management guidelines are described next in more detail.",NA
Program diagnosis,"An organization needs to assess its business objectives against current CRM programs to highlight the areas of 
 needed improvement and to identify where it can get the biggest bang for its investment. The diagnosis can examine 
 CRM approaches, conversation design, relationship styles, organizational structure, and IT infrastructure. 
 Understanding how these compare with other organizations and with best practices and how they fit into the 
 enterprise's business strategy will help identify areas for improvement.",NA
Strategy review,"An organization needs to review and assess its CRM strategies. The aim of this review is to develop an 
 understanding of the conversation designs and spaces that make its customer relationships profitable. This forms 
 the basis for a CRM game plan that is right for the organization and for the joint development of business and IT 
 strategies.",NA
Enterprise architecture,"The program diagnosis and strategy review steps will highlight the benefits of pulling all the CRM-related initiatives 
 that may be scattered across the company into a comprehensive, enterprisewide strategy. A CRM enterprise 
 architecture will help create new conversation spaces; transform customer information into a strategic tool to profile, 
 segment, target, and retain valuable customers; organize sales, marketing, and customer care in a consistent way;",NA
Enterprise application integration services,"One key to success in enterprise architecture development, and in CRM overall, is the seamless integration of 
 channels, people, and technologies into conversation spaces that deliver value to customers. Seamless customer 
 experiences, in turn, depend on the seamless integration of enterprisewide CRM application packages, legacy 
 applications, and Web-enabled systems. Meeting this challenge is the purpose of an enterprise application 
 integration (EAI) game plan.",NA
Package selection and implementation,"An organization needs a system for navigating through the crowded marketplace of CRM packages and assessing 
 the effect of changes on its business. Expert assistance is often required both for package assessment and for 
 implementation. Packages must be integrated into the IT environment and attention paid to process design and 
 change management. The aim is to develop a game plan for managing package selection, implementation, and 
 testing through multiyear life cycles. Beyond technical installation, the transformation of business processes must be 
 managed so that new software packages deliver maximum value.",NA
Application outsourcing assessment,"Like other software packages, CRM applications require support, maintenance, and enhancement over a period of 
 years. An organization needs to assess whether it would benefit by outsourcing responsibility for this technology-
 intensive side of the CRM program. Outsourcing may help it evolve and maintain its CRM application portfolio-call 
 centers, e-commerce, and so on-in a logically phased, cost-effective manner. All such contracts need to define 
 clearly the service-level agreements. The aim of this activity is to allow the enterprise to focus on customer 
 relationships, not the supporting technology.",NA
Implementation review,"An organization may need to get an overview of all CRM implementation activities to help it focus on the game plan 
 for building the complete set of business and technical solutions, whether in one area of the company or across the 
 enterprise. The aim is to ensure a coordinated approach to the design, redesign, or consolidation of CRM programs-
 e-commerce initiatives, call center operations, integrated customer information systems, and campaign management.",NA
Program and project management,"CRM involves a multiplicity of initiatives. Each initiative needs to be well managed. Just as importantly, all need to 
 fit into coherent CRM programs. Often advanced program and project management methods are required to 
 accomplish this. Program or project management offices (PMOs) can be created to ensure that CRM-related 
 projects deliver value and fully support strategic business initiatives.",NA
6.10 CRM solution: the value to the business,"A CRM solution that bridges service, sales, and marketing initiatives enables businesses to resolve problems 
 quicker, increase sales, achieve customer acquisition more effectively, and greatly enhance customer loyalty.",NA
Referrals,"It is an axiom of the marketplace that satisfied customers tell their friends about a supplier who maintains good 
 customer relations. One of the most powerful ways to acquire customers is word-of-mouth referral from a friend, 
 colleague, or family member. Businesses can harness these referrals when one of their customers adds personal 
 comments to an alert and forwards it to others who may be interested in the information and/or opportunities the 
 alert presents.",NA
Analytics,"The CRM analytics model has evolved to meet modern-day requirements. Although the concept hasn't changed 
 much from its early days, the process certainly has become far more scientific. Analytical CRM is the mining of 
 data and the application of mathematical, and sometimes common-sense, models in order to understand the 
 consumer better. By extrapolating useful insights into market and customer behaviors, companies can adjust 
 business rules and react to customers in a relevant, personalized manner.
  
 Because business is conducted with fewer face-to-face exchanges, getting to know and understand the customer 
 has become more complicated. The rise of e-business has driven the demand for more comprehensive tool sets for 
 data mining and knowledge interpretation. For an effective CRM initiative to accomplish its goals, CRM analytics 
 need to be incorporated into the process. CRM analytics provide the comprehensive insight necessary for 
 pinpointing revenue opportunities, enhancing sales channels, and mitigating cost risks. By providing meaningful 
 insight into data as well as transactional predictions, CRM analytics enable businesses to ensure that rules and 
 workflow are in step with customer demands. Analytics can be derived through several different channels, including
  
 ●     
 The Internet
  
 ●     
 Retail point of purchase
  
 ●     
 Direct marketing activities
  
 The challenge is to make sense out of the data gathered from customers from the multitude of customer touchpoints 
 into the organization.
  
 Analytical data mining solutions are a significant component of most CRM system packages, and call center 
 personnel should have some understanding of the relationship of data mining to their own call/contact center roles. 
 Data mining provides insight into corporate data stored in the data warehouse by using a variety of analytical 
 techniques to isolate causes and correlations within the customer interaction model. Data mining analytics can 
 perform predictive modeling of customer behavior, customer segmentation grouping, profitability analysis, what-if 
 scenarios, and campaign management, as well as personalization and event monitoring. These functions take 
 advantage of a customer's interactions with a business in real time. (see 
 Figure 6.13
 ) Strong analytics are necessary 
 to give a functional view of data relationships in 
  
 today's extremely complex business processes. By means of analytics, CRM can model future transactions, 
 predict the interests and behavior of individual customers, and translate data into more traditional channels 
 within the enterprise, such as the supply chain.",NA
CRM and the customer experience,"Automation streamlines internal processes, but technology can also quickly depersonalize the customer's 
 experience. CRM analytics offer insight and personalization that can go a long way toward improving that 
 experience and building customer loyalty.
  
 When they first start, all businesses have to focus on the needs of their customers. As businesses get larger and 
 more complex, however, they become more inward-looking as they try to cope with their internal issues. Often, the 
 customer gets treated as an afterthought. One goal of CRM is to make the individual customer become important 
 once again at an acceptable cost to the company. Until relatively recently, it was impossible for large companies to 
 form relationships with customers. With a customer base of millions, how can a company know their preferences or 
 dislikes? This is where technology can help businesses. Realistically, businesses do not implement CRM because 
 they have had a change of heart and decided to be nice to the long-suffering customer. Loyalty equals profit, and 
 both customers and businesses can gain from it. The ""management"" part of CRM demonstrates that it is the business 
 which ultimately controls the relationship with the customer. It provides the right information at the right time, it offers 
 the right price to keep the customer happy enough to stay, it anticipates what else the customer would like to buy, 
 and understands why. Thus, the business objective of CRM is to maximize profit from customers as a result of 
 knowing them, treating them well, and fulfilling their needs.
  
 Salesforce automation, customer contact solutions, multimedia routing, and data management tools—all have been 
 claimed as the key to a CRM solution. All are useful and reliable aids to a business, but none of them on their own is 
 a CRM solutions. They do, however, contribute to meeting CRM objectives.",NA
A CRM checklist,"Answers to the following questions can provide an organization with insight into its current customer-related 
 practices:
  
 ●     
 Is there a single view of the customer across the enterprise?
  
 ●     
 Do employees fulfill customer needs regardless of where in the company they are working?
  
 ●     
 Do customers receive a high level of service no matter which channel they decide to use?
  
 ●     
 Does the organization proactively and intelligently inform customers about products and services they will be 
 interested in and yet keep marketing costs under control?
  
 ●     
 Does the organization know who the most profitable customers are?
  
 ●     
 Are the strategy and tactics in place to keep them?",NA
6.11 Call/Contact center: driving force behind CRM,"The call/contact center plays a crucial role in developing and fulfilling corporate CRM strategies. Companies whose 
 main channel to their customers is through the telephone or e-mail, cannot become truly CRM-focused without 
 putting the center at the heart of any operational enhancements to their CRM strategy. It is both the recipient and 
 disseminator of information, relating to customers and to the business. CRM is about increasing revenues and 
 growing the business aggressively. Industry sectors such as retail, banking, and communications were among the 
 first to implement CRM, and their profit-focused approach toward their call or contact center operations is a model for 
 other sectors.
  
 When incorporated into a CRM strategy, the multimedia ""customer contact center"" brings both opportunities and 
 problems. Customers still need to be served, no matter what the communication medium is; however, managers may 
 initially encounter problems running a multimedia center in a CRM-focused business. There are a number of 
 channels to manage, training is more complex and diverse, and new CSR skills are required. 
 Chapter 3
  described the 
 key issues involved in moving from a telephony-only call center to a multimedia contact center as part 
  
 of a larger, enterprisewide CRM process. As this shift takes place, the call/contact center becomes less of a cost 
 center and more of an integrated, strategic, and profitable part of the enterprise and a key component of a CRM 
 strategy.",NA
CRM support mechanisms,"CRM is not a technology, but few companies can reengineer themselves to be truly customer facing without providing 
 their business and staff with the necessary tools. As for any major corporate project, there should be a defined 
 business need for the technology first, along with a measurable goal. Almost any technology can legitimately be said 
 to provide support for CRM implementations if the wider aim is to provide a superior level of customer contact based 
 on knowledge of that specific customer.
  
 Successful CRM depends as much upon attitude as it does upon technology, however. CRM is primarily an enabler 
 of growth for optimistic, aggressive companies wishing to expand. Business trends bear this out. Consider these 
 two approaches to CRM:",NA
IT-focused CRM,"Many first-wave CRM implementations focused very much on putting in technology solutions and improving 
 efficiency. Business processes and employees may not even be affected by IT-focused CRM, and in many cases, the 
 solution is CRM in name only—it may in fact be only a series of point solutions rather than a true CRM 
 implementation.",NA
Business-focused CRM,"Business-focused CRM involves a fresh look at how customers and prospects are actually dealt with by the 
 enterprise and focuses on discovering and solving commercial problems, changing the culture of the enterprise as a 
 whole to serve customers more effectively and profitably. Business-focused CRM encourages enterprises to 
 understand the value of an individual customer and to customize interactions to build loyalty and profit.
  
 Much of the difference between these approaches concerns attitude. The solution may end up being the same, but 
 the problem needs to be understood before it can be addressed.
  
 The impact of each of these CRM approaches is quite different on the call/contact center. In the IT-focused CRM 
 approach, a nontechnical customer who contacts the call center and who is likely to be amenable to upselling might 
 be pushed to a Website, which would be counterproductive. In this case, simply employing more sales agents or 
 increasing training would increase profitability. On the other hand, business-focused CRM may use a low-tech 
 solution for the customer—it does not simply look for ways to squeeze new technologies into the existing structure of 
 the enterprise. When considering the impact of each approach on the call/contact center, the following should be 
 taken into account:
  
 ●     
 Two-thirds of a contact center's running costs are CSR salaries.
  
 ●     
 Customers do not care about the IT department or business workflow—they decide whether the company is a 
 good one by the quality of its staff and the services they provide.",NA
CRM plays no favorites,"Every company that wants to increase profitability, reduce customer churn, gain market share, provide an outstanding 
 level of customer care, and foster customer loyalty needs to have a CRM strategy. True CRM implementations are 
 complex by nature and also require significant investment. However, because CRM is a long-term strategic goal, a 
 gradual rollout of supporting technologies is possible, as long as the company is aware of where it is heading overall. 
 Otherwise, the organization is just implementing a series of point solutions, which do not have the value of an 
 integrated solution.
  
 At first glance, CRM implementations seem to follow a pattern similar to most projects: analysis of requirements 
 followed by detailed design. After actual implementation comes postproject review. CRM is different not only in the 
 details but in the important role taken by the review stage. For many projects, a successful review is the end of the 
 story. Not for CRM—it is just another stage. CRM is an ongoing process, and so the review stage is fundamental to 
 the success of the project as a whole. For this reason, it should never be undervalued.
  
 Feedback should be given both in the analysis stage (for example, target metrics have been achieved, the overall 
 target is still viable) and also in the design stage, especially on any unforeseen technical issues that may require 
 changes in dependent subprojects. And while the expertise of external suppliers and consultants can be relied on in 
 the actual design and implementation of solutions, reviewing the business analysis stage in more detail can be 
 beneficial, because this is where complex CRM projects can fail through lack of planning or even through failure to 
 set specific targets.",NA
CRM success factors,"To sum up, when planning and implementing a CRM strategy, such as the 12-stage strategy described 
 previously in this chapter, the following key CRM success factors need to be considered:
  
 ●     
 Complete the business analysis stage before the design phase begins.
  
 ●     
 Pass on experience from the design and implementation stages in order to integrate it into major changes in 
 company direction and operation.
  
 ●     
 Choose at least one senior company member to drive the CRM initiative both from a commercial and cultural 
 perspective.
  
 ●     
 Get buy-in from senior members of all departments in the organization and establish a steering committee.
  
 ●     
 Benchmark operations before implementing any technology.
  
 ●     
 Consult customers on how they would like to see the business change.
  
 ●     
 Specify quantifiable improvements to the aspects of the business that are most important.
  
 ●     
 Work only with suppliers who have a proven track record and who will be reliable partners for the foreseeable 
 future.
  
 ●     
 Measure the impact of each subproject and feed the results back into the overall analysis and dependent 
 design phases of the CRM project.
  
 ●     
 Consult, inform, and train employees at every stage of the process to move the business culture more 
 toward a customer-focused organization.",NA
