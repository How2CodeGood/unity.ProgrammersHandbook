Preface,"L
 A
 TEX [
 42
 ] is a typesetting system that is very suitable for producing 
 scientific and mathematical documents of high typographical quality. It 
 is 
 also suitable for producing all sorts of other documents, from simple 
 letters to complete books. L
 A
 T
 E
 X uses T
 E
 X [
 39
 ] as its formatting engine.
  
  
 This short introduction will teach you all you need to get going with 
 L
 A
 TEX. Refer to [
 42
 ,
  48
 ] for a complete description of the L
 A
 TEX system. 
 This introduction is split into 7 chapters: 
 Chapter 1
  tells you about the basic structure of L
 A
 T
 E
 X documents. You 
 will also learn a bit about the history of L
 A
 TEX. After reading 
 this 
 chapter, you should have a rough understanding of how L
 A
 T
 E
 X 
 works. 
 Chapter 2
  goes into the details of typesetting your documents.  
 It 
  
  
 explains most of the essential L
 A
 T
 E
 X commands and environments. 
  
 After reading this chapter, you will be able to write your first  
  
 documents, with itemized lists, tables, graphics and floating bodies.
  
 Chapter 3
  explains how to typeset formulae with L
 A
 TEX. Many exam-
 ples demonstrate how to use one of L
 A
 TEX‚Äôs main strengths. 
 Chapter 4
  shows how to create bibliographies for your publications. 
 Chapter 5
  explains the secrets of indexes and some finer points about 
  
 creating PDFs. 
 Chapter 6
  shows how to use L
 A
 TEX for creating graphics. Instead of 
 drawing a picture with some graphics program, saving it to a file 
 and then including it into L
 A
 T
 E
 X, you describe the picture you want 
 and have L
 A
 TEX draw it for you. 
 Chapter 7
  contains some potentially dangerous information about how 
 to alter the standard document layout produced by L
 A
 TEX. You 
 will learn how to change things around in such a way that the 
 beautiful output of L
 A
 TEX turns ugly or stunning, depending on 
 your abilities.",NA

 T
 E
 X is a computer program created by Donald E. Knuth [
 39
 ]. The original 
 program was aimed at typesetting text and mathematical formulae. Knuth 
 started writing the TEX typesetting engine in 1977 to explore the 
 potential of digital printing equipment. These new devices were 
 beginning to infiltrate the publishing industry at that time. His goal was 
 to 
 reverse the trend of deteriorating typographical quality that he saw 
 affecting his own books and articles. The first stable version of T
 E
 X was 
 released in 1982. Version 3.0 was released in 1989 to better support 8-bit 
 characters and multiple languages. Knuth considered the T
 E
 X-design to 
 virtually bug free. The version number of TEX is converging to the 
 ùúãconstant and is now at 3.141592653. 
 or in the Scottish ‚ÄúLoch‚Äù‚Äô The ‚Äúch‚Äù 
 originates from the Greek alphabet
  
 1
 In German there are actually two pronunciations for ‚Äúch‚Äù and one might assume that 
 the soft ‚Äúch‚Äù sound from ‚ÄúPech‚Äù would be a more appropriate. When asked 
 about this by 
 one of the German Wikipedia contributors, Knuth wrote: ‚ÄúI do not get angry when people 
 pronounce T
 E
 X in their favorite way‚Ä¶and in Germany many use a 
 soft ch because the œá 
 follows the vowel e, not the harder ch that follows the vowel a. In Russia, ‚Äòtex‚Äô is a very 
 common word, pronounced ‚Äòtyekh‚Äô. But I believe the most",NA

Basics,"1.2.1 Author, Book Designer, and Typesetter
  
 To publish something, authors give their typed manuscript to a publishing 
 company. One of their book designers then decides the layout of the 
 document (column width, fonts, space before and after headings, ‚Ä¶). The 
 book designer writes his instructions into the manuscript and then gives it 
 to a typesetter, who typesets the book according to these instructions.
  
 A human book designer tries to find out what the author had in mind 
 while writing the manuscript. He decides on chapter headings, citations, 
 examples, formulae, etc., based on his professional knowledge and from 
 the contents of the manuscript. 
 In a L
 A
 T
 E
 X environment, L
 A
 T
 E
 X takes the role of the book designer and 
 uses T
 E
 X as its typesetter. But L
 A
 T
 E
 X is ‚Äúonly‚Äù a program and therefore 
 needs more guidance. The author has to provide additional information to 
 describe the logical structure of his work. This information is written 
 into 
 the text as ‚ÄúL
 A
 TEX commands.‚Äù 
 This is quite different from the WYSIWYG
 4
 approach that most modern 
 word processors, such as
  MS Word
  or
  LibreOffice
 , take. With these 
 applications, authors specify the document layout interactively 
 while 
 typing text into the computer. They can see on the screen how the 
 final 
 work will look when it is printed. 
 When using L
 A
 T
 E
 X, it is not normally possible to see the final output 
 while typing the text, but the final output can be previewed on the screen 
 after processing the file with L
 A
 T
 E
 X. Corrections can then be made before 
 actually sending the document to the printer.

TEX Input Files,"The input for L
 A
 TEX is a plain text file. On Unix-like systems text files are 
 pretty common. On Windows, one could use Notepad to create a 
 text file. 
 It contains the text of the document, as well as the commands that tell 
 L
 A
 T
 E
 X how to typeset the text. For beginners, it is recommended 
 to use a 
 L
 A
 TEX IDE.

 1.3.1 Spaces
  
 ‚ÄúWhitespace‚Äù characters, such as blank or tab, are treated uniformly 
 as‚Äúspace‚Äù by L
 A
 T
 E
 X. Several consecutive whitespace characters are treated 
 as
  one
  ‚Äúspace‚Äù. Whitespace at the start of a line is generally ignored, and 
 a single line break has the same effect as ‚Äúwhitespace‚Äù. 
 An empty line between two lines of text defines the end of a paragraph. 
 Multiple empty lines are treated the same as
  one
  empty line. The text 
 below is an example. On the left-hand side is the text from the input

Input File Structure,"When L
 A
 TEX processes an input file, it expects it to follow a certain 
 structure. Input files must start with the command 
 \documentclass{
 ‚å©
 class
 ‚å™
 }
  
 The ‚å©
 class
 ‚å™ argument specifies what sort of document you intend to 
 write. Available classes are listed in
  Table 1.1
 . Usually the article class is 
 sufficient. 
 Now begins an area of the input file that is called the
  preamble
 . Inside 
 it, you add commands to influence the style of the whole document, or 
 load packages that add new features to the L
 A
 T
 E
 X system. To load such 
 a 
 package, you use the command 
 ÔøΩsepackage{

  body

 command 
 \begin{

 TEX itself comes without a GUI or 
 fancy 
 buttons to press. It is just a program that crunches away at your
  
 input file. Some L
 A
 TEX installations feature a graphical front-end where 
 there is a L
 A
 TEX button to start compiling your input file. On other 
 systems, there might be some typing involved, so here is how to coax 
 L
 A
 TEX into compiling your input file on a text based system. Please 
 note: 
 this description assumes that a working L

 sits on 
 your computer. If this is not the case, you may want to look at

  first. 
 1. Edit/Create your L
 A
 TEX input file. This file must be plain text.  
 On 
 Unix-like systems, most of the editors will create just that. On
  
 Windows, you might want to make sure that you save the file in 
 Plain Text
  format. When picking a name for your file, make sure 
 it bears the extension .tex.

  cd

 to run L
 A

 references right. When your input file has a bug, L

 about it and stop processing your input file. Type ctrl-D to get back

Logical Structure of Your Document,"In
  subsection 1.2.2
 , we mentioned that one of the differences between 
 L
 A
 T
 E
 X and WYSIWYG editors is that in L
 A

 by 
 specifying its logical structure. This section will explore this idea in 
 more detail by presenting a problem and demonstrating how it can be 
 solved with logical markup. If you are familiar with the idea (for 
 example, you have worked with HTML and CSS), you can safely skip this 
 section. 
 1.6.1 
 A Neverending Story of Problems with WYSIWYG 
  
 Editors
  
 Let us imagine that you are writing a novel in your favourite WYSIWYG 
 editor. In this book, there are two parallel storylines happening in 
 different dimensions. In order to communicate to the reader which of 
 the dimensions is currently described, you have decided to use different 
 colours for them. Thus, your book may look like this: 
 ‚ÄúNo, thou canst leave me!‚Äùshouted Peredur to the Launcelot.
  
 ‚ÄúI have to‚Äù he replied. ‚ÄúDestiny calls upon me. But we shall 
 meet again. I promise.‚Äù
  
 Shao felt inexplicable sadness, as if they had just lost 
 something or someone important to them.
  
 ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù asked Ashby while eating her slurry.
  
 ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt look well.‚Äù
  
 ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, just tired.‚Äù
  
 After you finish your first draft, you decided to email it over to your 
 friend so they can share their opinion about it. However, it turns out 
 that 
 your friend‚Äôs printer can only print black and white, so they cannot 
 print 
 the file you sent them. 
 After some consideration, you decided to simply use cursive font for 
 one dimension, while keeping upright font for the other. After some time 
 of manually changing each paragraph of your book to match the 
 correct 
 font, you remembered that you have already used cursive font for 
 emphasis in some cases, such as ‚Äú
 Are you gonna eat
  that
 ?
 ‚Äù. Continuing 
 with your current approach you, would also have to check each paragraph 
 for emphasis and change it to something else before changing the font to 
 cursive. 
 The above problems with changing the style of paragraphs are caused 
 by the fact that your WYSIWYG editor doesn‚Äôt know that all green 
 paragraphs somehow represent common concept (events in one dimen-
 sion). It just remembers that you want these words in green, those in",NA
1.7 Packages,"While writing your document, you will probably find that there are some 
 areas where basic L
 A
 TEX cannot solve your problem. If you want

 It is not useful because there is very little reason to emphasise more than one 
 paragraph. In order to make the emphasis effective, it should be used with restraint. 
 After all, if everything is emphasised then nothing is.",NA

The Structure of Text and Language,"By Hanspeter Schmid 
 <hanspi@schmid-werren.ch>
  
 The main point of writing a text, is to convey ideas, information, or 
 knowledge to the reader. The reader will understand the text better if 
 these ideas are well-structured, and will see and feel this structure much 
 better if the typographical form reflects the logical and semantic 
 structure of the content. 
 As we have seen, L
 A
 TEX is different from other typesetting systems in 
 that you just have to tell it the logical and semantic structure of a 
 text. It 
 then derives the typographical form of the text according to the
 ‚Äúrules‚Äù 
 given in the document class file and in various style files. 
 The most important text unit in L
 A
 TEX (and in typography) is the 
 paragraph. We call it ‚Äútext unit‚Äù because a paragraph is the typographical 
 form that should reflect one coherent thought, or one idea. Therefore, if a 
 new thought begins, a new paragraph should begin, and if not, only line",NA
1.9 Files You Might Encounter,"When you work with L
 A
 TEX, you will soon find yourself in a maze of files 
 with various extensions and probably no clue. The following list explains 
 the various file types you might encounter when working with TEX.

 extensions, but if you find one missing that you think is important,

Line Breaking and Page Breaking,"2.1.1 
  
 Justified Paragraphs
  
 Books are often typeset with each line having the same length. L
 A
 TEX 
 inserts the necessary line breaks and spaces between words by optimising 
 the contents of a whole paragraph. If necessary, it also hyphenates words 
 that would not fit comfortably on a line. How the paragraphs are typeset 
 depends on the document class. Normally the first line of a paragraph is 
 indented, and there is no additional space between two paragraphs. Refer 
 to
  subsection 7.6.4
  for more information. 
 In special cases it might be necessary to order L

Ellipsis (‚Ä¶),"On a typewriter, a comma or a period takes the same amount of space as 
 any other letter. In book printing, these characters occupy only a little 
 space and are set very close to the preceding letter. Therefore, entering

 Instead, there is a special command for these dots. It is called

 When you write documents in languages other than English, there are 
 three areas where L
 A
 TEX has to be configured appropriately: 
 1.
  All automatically generated text strings (‚ÄúTable of Contents‚Äù, ‚ÄúList 
  
 of Figures‚Äù, ‚Ä¶) have to be adapted to the new language. 
 2.
  L
 A
 T
 E
 X needs to know the hyphenation rules for the current language.
  
 3.
  Language-specific typographic rules. For example, in French there 
  
 is a mandatory space before each colon character (:). 
 The package polyglossia [
 15
 ] is a replacement for the venerable babel 
 package. It takes care of the hyphenation patterns and automatically-
 generated text strings in your documents. Polyglossia works only with 
 the 
 X

 E
 X and
  LuaTEX
  engines, so if you are using
  pdfTEX
  you‚Äôll have 
 to stick 
 with babel. 
 2.8.1 
  
 Entering Characters
  
 Early versions of T
 E
 X were only intended to support the English language, 
 and thus assumed that source files were ASCII encoded; that is, in a 
 format 
 that only supports the Latin alphabet plus few symbols common 
 on 
 computers. With the popularization of L
 A
 TEX outside the English-speaking 
 world, the situation has slowly improved. These days TEX engines speak 
 UTF-8 natively, which considerably eases the usage of",NA

 multiple places of your documents. This is tedious and bears the risk of 
 introducing typos. Brand logos also often have special casing rules, such

2.10 ,NA,NA
The Space Between Words,"To produce a straight right-margin in its output, L
 A
 TEX inserts varying 
 amounts of space between words. It inserts slightly more space at the 
 end 
 of a sentence, as this makes the text more readable. L
 A
 T
 E
 X assumes 
 that 
 sentences end with periods, question marks or exclamation marks. If a 
 period follows an uppercase letter, this is not taken as the end of a 
 sentence, since periods after uppercase letters normally occur in 
 abbreviations.",NA
"2.11 Titles, Chapters, and Sections","To help the reader find his or her way through your work, you should 
 divide it into chapters, sections, and subsections. L
 A
 TEX supports this 
 with special commands that take the section title as their argument. It is 
 up to you to use them in the correct order. 
  
 The following sectioning commands are available for the article 
 class: 
 \section{

 If you want to split your document into parts without influencing the 
 section or chapter numbering use 
 \part{

 When you work with the
  report
  or

  class, an additional top-level 
 sectioning command becomes available:

 add articles as chapters to a book. The spacing between sections, the",NA

2.17 Code Listings,"When writing about L
 A
 TEX, or other programming languages, you often 
 need to insert short code snippets like this \LaTeX{}. While you could 
 escape all the characters, this would quickly become rather tiresome, 
 especially for longer pieces of code where correct spacing is crucial for 
 readability (multiple spaces being collapsed by L
 A
 TEX to singles). We 
 will present three solutions to this problem. 
 2.17.1 Verbatim
  
 L
 A
 TEX itself comes with the
  \verb
  command. It is unusual in that it 
 does 
 not use groups for getting its first argument. Instead, you pass the 
 argument between a chosen delimiter that can be any character except a 
 letter, * or space. For example, to use | as the delimiter (as is typical), you 
 type 
 \verb
 |‚å©
 text
 ‚å™| 
 Any text that is enclosed between these delimiters will be directly printed, 
 as if typed on an old typewriter (in a monospaced font), with all spaces, 
 and without any L
 A
 TEX commands being executed. 
 Use
  \verb
 |
 \LaTeX{}
 | to 
 print
  \LaTeX
 .
  
 We normally use
  \verb
 +|+ but 
 when it's not available we use
  
 \verb
 |+| to delimit the argument of 
 the
  \verb
 |
 \verb
 | command.
  
 Use \LaTeX{} to print L
 A
 TEX. 
 We normally use | but when it‚Äôs 
 not available we use + to delimit 
 the argument of the \verb com-
 mand.",NA
2.18,NA,NA
Tables,"In L
 A
 T
 E
 X, the environment to typeset tables (and more) is called
  tabular
 . 
 While it can be used on its own, the resulting table layouts look extremely 
 old fashioned. We recommend adding the booktabs [
 17
 ] package, which 
 provides several commands that let you typeset beautiful modern looking 
 tables. 
 Note that the booktabs [
 17
 ] package does not modify the tabular 
 environment, it just adds some extra commands for spacing and adding 
 lines to your tables. If you write for a publication which has other 
 requirements, like not using any extra packages, simply do not use the 
 extra commands from booktabs [
 17
 ]. 
 To achieve some more advanced table layouts, you will also learn 
 about the longtable [
 11
 ], array [
 46
 ] and multirow [
 51
 ] packages in this 
 section. They are so useful, that you‚Äôll probably want to put them all into 
 the preamble of your document right away. 
 In addition to a description of its commands, the booktabs documen-
 tation [
 17
 ] contains guidelines on typesetting professional-looking tables. 
 We have taken these guidelines to heart when writing this booklet. You 
 will 
 find some of them in this section. 
 2.18.1 Basic Tables
  
 The environment tabular has the following form 
 \begin{
 tabular
 }
 [‚å©
 pos
 ‚å™]
 {
 ‚å©
 colspec
 ‚å™
 }
  
 The ‚å©
 colspec
 ‚å™ argument, which stands for column specifiers, defines the 
 format of the columns in the table.  
 Use an l for a column of left-
 aligned text,
  r
  for right-aligned text, and
  c
  for centred text. Within the 
 environment, use
  &
  to begin the next cell within the current row, and
  \\ 
 to 
 begin the next row. 
 \begin{
 tabular
 }{
 lcr
 }
  
 left
  &
  centre
  &

 \\
  
 \end{
 tabular
 }
  
  
 left

 centre 2 right

 Note that the text inside the cells will not be wrapped. If you want 
 the 
 column to contain justified text with line breaks, use the
  p{
 ‚å©
 width

 }",NA
2.19 Including Graphics and Images,"L
 A
 TEX itself does not provide facilities to include images. In order to so, 
 it is necessary to use the graphicx [
 10
 ] package. It provides the 
 \includegraphics
 [
 ‚å©
 options
 ‚å™
 ]
 {
 ‚å©
 file
 ‚å™
 }
  
 command that can be used to include the ‚å©
 file
 ‚å™ in the document.

Image,"The file may be a PDF, PNG or JPEG. If you omit the extension, then 
 L
 A
 TEX 
 will try the following in order: .pdf, .png, .jpg, .mps, .jpeg, .jbig2, .jb2. Note 
 that if your filename contains dots (other than the extension dot), then 
 its basename has to be put in curly braces like so: 
 \includegraphics{{
 image.with.dots
 }
 .jpg
 }
  
 The ‚å©
 options
 ‚å™ parameter is a comma delimited list of keys and values. 
 The most basic keys are
  width
  and
  height
 . If only one is supplied, then 
 L
 A
 TEX will calculate the other to keep the aspect ratio of the original

Floating Bodies,"If you try writing a longer text with tables and images, you will soon 
 notice a problem: they cannot be broken across multiple pages (except 
 for longtables). If you simply include them in normal text flow, this will 
 lead to a lot of empty space if the image is large and the text preceding 
 it 
 would be to close to the bottom of the page. In
  Listing 2.12
  the first page 
 is half empty. 
 The solution to this problem is to ‚Äòfloat‚Äô any figure or table that 
 does 
 not fit on the current page to a later page, while filling the current 
 page 
 with body text. L
 A
 TEX offers two environments for floating bodies; one for 
 tables and one for figures. To take full advantage of these two 
 environments, it is important to understand approximately how L
 A
 TEX 
 handles floats internally. Otherwise, floats may become a major source of 
 frustration, because L
 A
 TEX never puts them where you want them to be. 
 Let‚Äôs first have a look at the commands L
 A
 TEX supplies for floats. 
 Any 
 material enclosed in a
  figure
  or
  table
  environment will be treated 
 as 
 floating matter. 
 \begin{
 figure
 }
 [‚å©
 placement specifier
 ‚å™] 
 \begin{
 table

 [‚å©
 placement specifier
 ‚å™] 
 The optional ‚å©
 placement specifier
 ‚å™ parameter is used to tell L
 A
 T
 E
 X about 
 the 
 locations to which the float is allowed to be moved. A ‚å©
 placement 
 specifier
 ‚å™ 
 is constructed by building a string of
  float-placing permissions
 . See
  Table 2.2
  
 for a description of available specifiers. Note that the order 
 of the specifiers 
 does not matter. 
 For example, a table float could be started with the following line:

 Use

  to create a reference to a float within your text. 
 Note that the
  \label
  command must come
  after
  the
  \caption 
 command, 
 since you want it to reference the number of the caption. 
 Listing 2.14
  
 presents an example usage of these commands. 
 Under certain circumstances it might be necessary to use the 
 \clearpage
  or even the
  \cleardoublepage
  
 command. It orders L
 A
 TEX to immediately place all floats remaining in 
 the queues and then start a new page.
  \cleardoublepage
  even goes to 
 a 
 new right-hand page. 
 2.20.1 Createing your own Float-Types
  
 If you want to have other float types besides ‚ÄúTable‚Äù and ‚ÄúFigure‚Äù, use 
 the newfloat [

2.21 Big Projects,"When working on big documents, you might want to split the input file 
 into several parts. L
 A
 TEX has two commands that help you do this. 
 Use the 
 \include{
 ‚å©
 filename
 ‚å™
 }
  
  
 command in the document body to insert the contents of another file 
 named
  filename.tex
 .  
 Note that L
 A
 TEX will start a new page before 
 processing the material input from
  filename.tex
 . 
  
 The second command can be used in the preamble. It allows you to 
 instruct L
 A
 TEX to only input some of the
  \include
 d files. 
  
 \includeonly{

 After this command is executed in the preamble of the document, only 
 \include
  commands for the filenames that are listed in the argument of 
 the
  \includeonly
  command will be executed. 
 The
  \include
  command starts typesetting the included text on a new 
 page. This is helpful when you use
  \includeonly
 , because the page breaks 
 will not move, even when some
  \include
  files are omitted. 
 Sometimes this might not be desirable. In this case, use the
