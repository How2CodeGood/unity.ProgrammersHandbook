Preface,"Created in 1988 by John Ousterhoult, while working at the University of Califormia, 
 Berkeley, Tcl (Tool Command Language) is a scripting language originally designed for 
 embedded system platforms. Since its creation, Tcl has grown far beyond its original design 
 with numerous expansions and additions (such as the graphical Took Kit or Tk) to become a 
 full-featured scripted programming language capable of creating elegant, cross-platform 
 solutions.

 Launching a Tcl script",NA
Introduction,"So, you've installed Tcl, written some scripts, and now you're ready to get a deeper 
  
 understanding of Tcl and all that it has to offer. So, why are we starting with the shell 
  
 when it is the most basic tool in the Tcl toolbox?
  
 When I started using Tcl I needed to rapidly deliver a GraphicalUserInterface (GUI) to display 
  
 a video from the IP-based network cameras. The solution had to run on Windows and Linux 
  
 and it could not be browser-based due to the end user's security concerns. The client needed 
  
 it quickly and our sales team had, as usual, committed to a delivery date without speaking to 
  
 the developer in advance. So, with the requirement document in hand, I researched the open 
  
 source tools available at the time and Tcl/Tk was the only language that met the challenge.",NA
The Tcl shell,"The TclShell (Tclsh) provides an interface to the Tcl interpreter that accepts commands from 
 both standard input and text files. Much like the Windows Command Line or Linux Terminal, 
 the Tcl shell allows a developer to rapidly invoke a command and observe the return value or 
 error messages in standard output. The shell differs based on the Operating System in use. For 
 the Unix/Linux systems, this is the standard terminal console; while on a Windows system, the 
 shell is launched separately via an executable.
  
 If invoked with no arguments, the shell interface runs interactively, accepting commands 
 from the native command line. The input line is demarked with a percent sign (%) with the 
 prompt located at the start position. If the shell is invoked from the command line (Windows 
 DOS or Unix/Linux terminal) and arguments are passed, the interpreter will accept the first 
 as the filename to be read. Any additional arguments are processed as variables. The shell 
 will run until the 
 exit
  command is invoked or until it has reached the end of the text file.",NA
Writing to the Tcl console,"The following recipe illustrates a basic command invocation. In this example, we will use 
 the 
 puts
  command to output a ""Hello World"" message to the console.",NA
Getting ready,"To complete the following example, launch your Tcl Shell as appropriate, based on your 
 operating platform. For example, on Windows, you would launch the executable contained 
 in the Tcl installation location within the 
 bin
  directory, while on a Unix/Linux installation, 
 you would enter 
 TCLsh
  at the command line, provided this is the executable name for your 
 particular system. To check the name, locate the executable in the 
 bin
  directory of your 
 installation.",NA
How to do it…,"Enter the following command:
  
 % puts ""Hello World""
  
 Hello World",NA
How it works…,"As you can see, the 
 puts
  command writes what it was passed as an argument to standard 
 out. Although this is a basic ""Hello World"" recipe, you can easily see how this 'simple' 
 command can be used for rapid tracking of the location within a procedure, where a problem 
 may have arisen. Add in variable values and some error handling and you can rapidly isolate 
 issues and correct them without the additional efforts of creating a Dialog Window or 
 writing to an error log.",NA
Mathematical expressions,"The 
 expr
  command is used to evaluate mathematical expressions. This command can address 
 everything from simple addition and subtraction to advanced computations, such as sine and 
 cosine. This eliminates the need to make system calls to perform advanced mathematical 
 functions. The 
 expr
  command evaluates the input and arguments, and returns an integer or 
 floating-point value.
  
 A Tcl expression consists of a combination of operators, operands, and parenthetical 
 containers (parenthesis, braces, or brackets). There are no strict typing requirements, so any 
 white space is stripped by the command automatically. Tcl supports non-numeric and string 
 comparisons as well as Tcl-specific operators.",NA
Tcl expr operands,"Tcl operands are treated as integers, where feasible. They may be specified as decimal, binary 
 (first two characters must be 0b), hexadecimal (first two characters must be 0x), or octal (first 
 two characters must be 0o). Care should be taken when passing integers with a leading 0, for 
 example 08, as the interpreter would evaluate 08 as an illegal octal value. If no integer formats 
 are included, the command will evaluate the operand as a floating-point numeric value. For 
 scientific notations, the character e (or E) is inserted as appropriate. If no numeric 
 interpretation is feasible, the value will be evaluated as a string. In this case, the value must be 
 enclosed within double quotes or braces. Please note that not all operands are accepted by all 
 operators.  To avoid inadvertent variable substitution, it is always best to enclose the 
 operands within braces. For example, take a look at the following:
  
 f 
  
 expr 1+1*3
  will return a value of 
 4
 .
  
 f 
  
 expr (1+1)*3
  will return a value of 
 6
 .",NA
Mathematical functions,"Mathematical functions (such as sine and cosine) are replaced with a call to the Tcl 
  
 mathfunc
  namespace. This does not require any additional syntax to access the namespace as 
 it is called automatically. These are invoked by passing the Function followed by the value or 
 values to evaluate to the expr command. Those functions that accept multiple arguments 
 require that the arguments be comma delimited. The default Mathematical functions are listed 
 below in alphabetical order. These functions require a specific syntax (for example 
 expr 
 {function(value,value)}
 ) to be accessed, as described in the 
 Computing mathematical 
 expressions
  section that follows:
  
 Function Result
  
 abs arg 
 Returns the absolute value of 
 arg
 .
  
 Numeric operators may be integer or floating-point. Value is returned in 
  
 the same format.
  
 acos arg 
 Returns the arc cosine of 
 arg
 .
  
 asin arg 
 Returns the arc sine of 
 arg
 .
  
 atan arg 
 Returns the Arc Tangent of x/y.
  
 bool arg 
 Returns the Boolean value of 
 arg
  where non-numeric values are 
 true
 , 
  
 otherwise the value is 
 false
 .
  
 ceil arg 
 Returns the smallest floating-point integer value not less than 
 arg
 .
  
 Any numeric value is acceptable.
  
 cos arg 
 Returns the cosine of 
 arg
 , measured in radians.
  
 If the result produces an over-flow, an error is returned.
  
 double arg 
 Converts 
 arg
  to its floating-point value.
  
 May return INF or –INF when the numeric value is such that it exceeds 
  
 the floating-point value.
  
 entier arg 
 Converts 
 arg
  to its integer value.
  
 exp arg 
 Returns the exponential of 
 arg
 .
  
 If the result produces an over-flow, an error is returned.
  
 floor arg 
 Returns the largest floating-point integer not greater than 
 arg
 .
  
 The argument may be any numeric value.
  
 fmod x y 
 Returns the remainder of 
 x/y
  as a floating-point integer.
  
 If 
 y
  is a zero (0), then an error is returned.
  
 hypot x y 
 Returns the length of the hypotenuse of a right angled triangle.
  
 int arg 
 Returns the low order bits of 
 arg
  up to the machine word size.
  
 isqrt arg 
 Returns the integer portion of the square root of 
 arg
 .
  
 Arg must be a positive value (integer or floating-point).",NA
Computing mathematical expressions,"In the following examples, we will see the correct syntax for both simple and complex 
  
 mathematical formulas. To accomplish these computations, we will be using the Tcl 
 expr 
 command. The 
 expr
  command, as its name implies, is used to evaluate mathematical 
 expressions. This command can address everything from simple addition and subtraction to 
 advanced computations such as sine and cosine. This removes the need to make system calls 
 to perform advanced mathematical functions. The 
 expr
  command evaluates the input and 
 arguments and returns an integer, floating-point, or string value as appropriate.",NA
Referencing files in Tcl,"Tcl commands that accept filenames as arguments require that they be in one of three 
 formats, depending on the platform in use. The platform in use is stored in the global 
 TCL_platform
  array variable, created at the start of the program. Please note that to 
 address issues of portability, you must manually manipulate the formats to ensure that 
 they are annotated correctly.
  
 These formats are absolute, relative, and volume-related.
  
 File Formats Explanation
  
 Absolute Absolute names are fully qualified and give a path to the file relative to a particular 
 volume.
  
 Relative Relative filenames are unqualified and give the path to the desired file relative to 
 the current working directory.
  
 Volume-related Volume-related filenames are partially qualified and either accepts the path 
 relative to the current working directory on the current volume, or relative to the directory 
 of a specified directory.",NA
"UNIX (UNIX, Linux and Mac OS X)","On the UNIX style platforms, Tcl uses path names, wherein the various components are 
 separated by the slash (/) character. Multiple adjacent slashes are handled as a single 
 occurrence. Trailing slashes are ignored completely. For example, passwd and passwd/ both 
 refer to the file passwd in the current directory
  
 Convention Meaning
  
 . Special character that refers to the current directory
  
 .. Special character that refers to the parent directory
  
 / Root directory
  
 /etc/passwd 
 Absolute path to the file passwd in the directory etc
  
 passwd 
 Relative path to the file passwd in the current directory
  
 etc/passwd 
 Relative path to the file passwd in the directory etc from the current 
  
 working directory
  
 ../passwd 
 Relative path to the file passwd in the parent directory",NA
Windows,"Tcl supports both drive-related and UniversalNamingConvention (UNC) file naming 
 conventions. Both the slash (/) and backslash (\) characters may be used as separators; 
 however, care must be exercised when utilizing the backslash characters, as they can result 
 in undesirable effects 
 if
  the filename is not enclosed within quotes. Drive-related filenames 
 consist of the optional drive letter followed by the absolute or relative path. UNC filenames 
 follow the form of 
 \\servername\sharename\path\file
 . The UNC filename must 
 contain the server and share components, at least.
  
 Convention 
  
 Meaning
  
 . 
  
 Special character that refers to the current directory
  
 .. 
  
 Special character that refers to the parent directory
  
 \\MyServer\ 
  
 Absolute UNC path to the file passwd on server MyServer in the share 
  
 MyShare\passwd 
  
 MyShare
  
 C:passwd 
  
 Volume related path to the file passwd in the current directory
  
 C:\passwd 
  
 Absolute path to the file passwd in the root directory of the C drive",NA
Variables,"As with all the programming languages, it is the variable that allows for true flexibility and 
 usability. Tcl differs from some scripted languages, as, there is no need to implicitly declare 
 the variable type. For example a variable of ""3"" will be stored within Tcl with the same 
 internal representation, as if it have been defined as the integer 3. If the variable is then used 
 in a calculation, Tcl will then convert it to an integer for computation. This is referred to as 
 shimmering in Tcl.",NA
Basic variable commands,"Variable command Explanation
  
 global var 
 This command is used to declare a global variable. It is only required within the 
 body of a procedure.
  
 incr var value 
 This command will increment the value stored in 
 var
  by the value 
 provided. Value must contain an integer. If no value is passed, the command defaults to 
 increase the value by one (1).
  
 set var value 
 This command sets 
 var
  to the value provided. Conversely, the value may 
 contain a Tcl command, the results of which will be utilized as the final value. The Command 
 must be enclosed within square braces.
  
 unset var var var 
 The unset command deletes one or more variables. If the 
 –
 nocomplain
  flag is passed as the first argument, all the errors are suppressed. Variable names 
 are NOT comma delimited.
  
 In the following examples, we will create a variable with an integer value of 3, increment that 
 value, and then delete the variable.",NA
Getting Ready ,"To complete the following examples, launch your Tcl Shell as appropriate, based on 
 your operating platform.",NA
How to do it…,"For setting a variable, enter the following command: 
  
 % set x 3 
  
 3",NA
How it works…,"The set command returns 
 3
  to confirm that the value was set correctly.",NA
There's more…,"Enter the following command: 
  
 % incr x 3 
  
 6 
  
 The 
 incr
  command has increased the value of 
 x
  by 
 3
  and returned 
 6
 .
  
 Unsetting a variable 
  
 Enter the following command: 
  
 % unset x 
  
 % 
  
 The 
 unset
  command deletes the variable 
 x
  and simply returns to the command prompt. If 
 the named variable does not exist, an error will be generated, as shown in the following 
 example: 
  
 % unset y 
  
 can't unset ""y"": no such variable 
  
 To avoid error reporting for variables, include the 
 –nocomplain
  switch, as illustrated 
 here: 
 % unset –nocomplain y 
  
 %",NA
Command line arguments,"With any scripting language, the ability to provide arguments allows you to write a script 
 that accepts arguments to perform a specific function.
  
 As previously discussed, Tcl has several global variables to allow for the passing of command 
 line arguments. The number of command line arguments to a Tcl script is passed as the 
 global variable 
 argc
 . The name of a Tcl script is passed to the script as the global variable 
 argv0
 , and the arguments are passed as a list in the 
 argv
  global variable.",NA
Launching a Tcl script,"In the following example we will invoke a Tcl script contained within a text file.  This script 
 will accept any number of arguments and print out the script name, the count of the 
 arguments and the values contained within the 
 argv
  variable.",NA
Getting Ready,"To complete the following example we will need to create a Tcl script file in your 
 working directory. Open your text editor of choice and follow the instructions below.",NA
How to do it…,"Create a text file named 
 args.tcl
  that contains the following commands.
  
 # If no command line arguments are passed perform no actions
  
 if {$argc > 0} { 
  
 # Print out the filename of the script
  
 puts ""The name of the script is: $argv0""
  
 # Print out the count of the arguments passed
  
 puts ""Total count of arguments passed is: $argc""
  
 # Print out a list of the arguments

 # Using the List Index of argv print a specific argument
  
 puts ""The first argument passed was [lindex $argv 0]""
  
 }",NA
How it works…,"As you can see, the script accepts any number of arguments and using the Tcl global variables 
 allows access to the arguments passed as either a list or individual values. Keep in mind that 
 when passing control characters, they must be escaped using the backslash character.",NA
There's more…,"Invoke the script with the following command line:

 The arguments passed are: home etc 
  
 The first argument passed was home
  
 %
  
 In the above example you can see that the backslash characters are removed. This is NOT 
 done by Tcl, but rather by the shell from which Tcl was invoked.
  
 Now invoke the script with the escape character added:
  
 % Tclsh85 args.Tcl \\home \\etc 
  
 The name of the script is: args.Tcl

 creation of procedures, as well as managing the flow of events.
  
 Prior to the creation of constructs the programmer's primary tool was the 
 goto
  statement. 
  
 While this allowed recursive handling of conditions and minimized impact on memory usage, 
  
 it resulted in non-modular code and added substantially to the overhead of debugging and 
  
 maintenance.",NA
Controlling flow with the if statement,"The 
 if
  command evaluates a condition and if the condition evaluates to true, the actions

 performed.",NA
How to do it…,"In the following recipe, we will create a Tcl script to be called from the command line that 
 evaluates the argument passed, and based on the argument provided, perform an action.

Looping with for,"The 
 for
  command performs the actions desired as long as the condition is met. In this 
 manner the condition is repeatedly evaluated and the actions are performed as long as 
 the condition remains true. The syntax of the

 (
 start
 , 
 test
 , and 
 next
 ) and a body:
  
 for start test next body
  
 The 
 start
 , 
 next
 , and the body arguments must be in the form of Tcl command strings with 
 test
  as an expression string. The 
 for
  command invokes the interpreter to execute 
 start
 . 
 Then, it repeatedly evaluates 
 test
  as an expression. While the result is non-zero, it invokes 
 the Tcl interpreter on body. Then, it invokes the interpreter on 
 next
  and repeats the loop. 
 The command terminates when 
 test
  is evaluated to 0.

 substitution prior to processing, which may result in the dreaded infinite loop.",NA

Introduction,"As discussed in the introduction to this book, I eventually learned the true power of the Tcl 
 shell and how it can be used to locate and diagnose issues within the code. By using the 
 puts 
 statement I was able to track changes in variables and isolate sections of the code that were 
 presenting issues.
  
 In this chapter we will investigate the commands built into the Tcl shell that allow for more 
 elegant error handling and isolation of sections of code to ensure that they perform correctly 
 before proceeding with a procedure.
  
 Error handling within Tcl allows the developer the freedom to determine how to react to an 
 error. In the following sections we will explore Tcl error handling by implementing these 
 control constructs to illustrate how you can use error handling to proceed with the command 
 without raising an error or returning a Tcl error code. Based on which error handling 
 command you decide to use, you can react accordingly and present the end user with the 
 desired result.",NA
Using the catch command,"The 
 catch
  construct is used to prevent errors from aborting a script. The 
 catch
  construct is 
 a method of isolating errors and allowing you to determine how to proceed. This allows you 
 to present the end user with a customized notification, as opposed to a system-defined error 
 message, which may have no meaning to the user.
  
 In the event an error condition exists, the 
 catch
  command returns a non-zero integer value 
 corresponding to the Tcl return code. Tcl provides four exceptional return codes. A return 
 value of 1 (
 TCL_ERROR
 ) indicates that an error has occurred and the value is stored in the 
 result. A return of 2 (
 TCL_RETURN
 ) is generated by the 
 return
  command. A return of 3 
 (
 TCL_BREAK
 ) is generated by the 
 break
  command. A return of 4 (
 TCL_CONTINUE
 ) is 
 returned by the 
 continue
  command.
  
 If the 
 optionalVarName
  is provided, it will be set to a dictionary containing the return 
 values. This dictionary (see 
 Chapter 6
  for further information on the Tcl Dictionary data 
 type) will always contain two entries at least: 
 -code
  (this will be the same as the return 
 code) and 
 -level
 . For more information on level, see the return section in the command 
 list.
  
 When an error exists three additional entries are defined within the dictionary. These are 
 -
 errorinfo
 , 
 -errorcode
 , and 
 -errorline
 . The 
 -errorinfo
  will contain a stack trace 
 containing the information of the error. The 
 –errorcode
  is additional information on the 
 error stored in a list. The 
 –errorline
  entry is an integer representing the line of the script 
 where the error occurred.",NA
Getting ready,"To complete the following example, we will need to create a Tcl script file in your 
 working directory. Open the text editor of your choice and follow the instructions given 
 next.",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will prompt the user for a numeric value to be doubled. If an 
 incorrect value is provided, the script will generate an error. Using the editor of your 
 choice, create a text file named 
 catch.tcl

 # Prompt the user for a number 
  
 puts -nonewline ""Enter a number: "" 
  
 # Clear standard out

 Enter a number: bad_data
  
 Script Failed - invalid bareword ""bad_data""
  
 in expression ""bad_data * 2"";",NA
Using the eval command,"The 
 eval
  command accepts one or more arguments that, when combined, create a Tcl script. 
 When invoked, it passes the stored script to the command interpreter and behaves as a 
 normal command, returning the values or errors that may have resulted.
  
 Although the 
 eval
  command is not an error handling construct in itself, it provides an 
 elegant methodology for utilizing Tcl commands as variables themselves.  This allows 
 greater freedom for passing commands to procedures and constructs, for example the error 
 handling constructs referenced here.",NA
Getting ready,"To complete the following example, we will need to access Tcl from the command line. 
 Launch the Tcl shell appropriately for your operating system and follow the given 
 instructions.",NA
How to do it…,"In addition to allowing the return of the error within the return value, any script can be 
 stored and evaluated using the 
 eval
  command. In the following example, we will use the 
 eval 
 command combined with the 
 exec
  command to call a system program. In this 
 example, we will use Notepad, the Windows program. For other operating systems, please 
 enter any program that exists within your path. Enter the following into your Tcl command 
 line:
  
 % set command {puts ""Hello world""}
  
 puts ""Hello World""
  
 % eval $command
  
 % Hello World",NA
How it works…,"The 
 eval
  command has passed the command defined to the interpreter and 
 executed the

 filename after the 
 eval
  statement to pass this argument to the command.

 notepad} 
  
 exec notepad 
  
 % eval $command catch.tcl
  
 By employing the 
 eval
  command, you can isolate scripts into a variable and evaluate the 
 script in its entirety. Encasing the 
 eval
  command into a 
 catch
  statement to determine the 
 success is a very effective means of trapping errors at the time they occur and avoiding 
 program failure or, inadvertently, accepting incorrect or undesirable values in your scripts.",NA
Using the error command,"The primary usage of the 
 error
  command is to programmatically raise an error. This 
 allows you to interrupt the interpreter at the desired point and to present the user with an 
 error message of your choice.",NA

Introduction,"When I first started using Tcl, everything I read or researched stressed the mantra 
 ""Everything is a string"". Coming from a hard-typed coding environment, I was used to 
 declaring variable types and in Tcl this was not needed. A 
 set
  command could—and still 
 does—create the variable and assigns the type on the fly. For example, 
 set variable ""7""
  
 and 
 set variable 7
  will both create a variable containing 
 7
 . However, with Tcl, you can 
 still print the variable containing a numeric 
 7
  and add 
 1
  to the variable containing a string 
 representation of 
 7
 .
  
 It still holds true today that everything in Tcl is a string. When we explore the Tk Toolkit 
 and widget creation, you will rapidly see that widgets themselves have a set of string 
 values that determine their appearance and/or behavior.
  
 As a pre-requisite for the recipes in this chapter, launch the Tcl shell as appropriate for 
 your operating system. You can access Tcl from the command line to execute the 
 commands.
  
 As with everything else we have seen, Tcl provides a full suite of commands to assist in 
 handling string expressions. However due to the sheer number of commands and subsets, I 
 won't be listing every item individually in the following section. Instead we will be creating 
 numerous recipes and examples to explore in the following sections. Please refer to the 
 Tcl/Tk Commands
  listing at the end of this book. A general list of the commands is as follows:
  
 Command 
  
 Description
  
 string 
  
 The string command contains multiple keywords (see the section covering 
  
 the command) allowing for manipulation and data gathering functions.
  
 append 
  
 Appends to a string variable.
  
 format 
  
 Format a string in the same manner as C 
 sprint
 .
  
 regexp 
  
 Regular expression matching.
  
 regsub 
  
 Performs substitution, based on Regular expression matching.",NA
Appending to a string,"Creating a string in Tcl using the 
 set
  command is the starting point for all string commands. 
  
 This will be the first command for most, if not all of the following recipes. As we have seen 
 previously, entering a 
 set
  variable value on the command line does this. However, to fully 
 implement strings within a Tcl script, we need to interact with these strings from time to 
 time, for example, with an open channel to a file or HTTP pipe. To accomplish this, we will 
 need to read from the channel and append to the original string.
  
 To accomplish appending to a string, Tcl provides the 
 append
  command. The 
 append 
 command is as follows:
  
 append variable value value value…",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will create a string of comma-delimited numbers using 
 the 
 for
  control construct. Return values from the commands are provided for clarity. 
 Enter the following command:
  
 % set var 0 
  
 0 
  
 % for {set x 1} {$x<=10}{$x<=10} {incr x} { 
  
 append var , $x 
  
 } 
  
 %puts $var
  
 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10",NA
How it works…,"The 
 append
  command accepts a named variable to contain the resulting 
 string
  and a 
 space delimited list of strings to append. As you can see, the 
 append
  command accepted our 
 variable argument and a string containing the comma. These values were used to append to 
 original variable (containing a starting value of 
 0
 ). The resulting string output with the 
 puts 
 command displays our newly appended variable complete with commas.",NA
Formatting a string,"Strings, as we all know, are our primary way of interacting with the end user. Whether 
 presented in a message box or simply directed to the Tcl shell, they need to be as fluid as 
 possible, in the values they present. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 format
  
 command. This command allows us to format a string with variable substitution in the 
 same manner as the ANSI C 
 sprintf
  procedure. The 
 format
  command is as follows:
  
 format string argument argument argument…
  
 The 
 format
  command accepts a string containing the value to be formatted as well as 
 % 
 conversion specifiers. The arguments contain the values to be substituted into the final 
 string. 
  
 Each conversion specifier may contain up to six sections—an XPG2 position specifier, a set 
 of flags, minimum field width, a numeric precision specifier, size modifier, and a 
 conversion character. The conversion specifiers are as follows:
  
 Specifier Description
  
 d
  or 
 i 
 For converting an integer to a signed decimal string.
  
 u 
 For converting an integer to an unsigned decimal string.
  
 o 
 For converting an integer to an unsigned octal string.
  
 x
  or 
 X 
 For converting an integer to an unsigned hexadecimal string.
  
 The lowercase x is used for lowercase hexadecimal notations.
  
 The uppercase 
 X
  will contain the uppercase hexadecimal notations.
  
 c 
 For converting an integer to the Unicode character it represents.
  
 s 
 No conversion is performed.

Matching a regular expression within a string,"Regular expressions provide us with a powerful method to locate an arbitrarily complex 
 pattern within a string. The 
 regexp
  command is similar to a Find function in a text editor. You 
 search for a defined string for the character or the pattern of characters you are looking for 
 and it returns a Boolean value that indicates success or failure and populates a list of optional 
 variables with any matched strings. The 
 -indices
  and 
 -inline
  options must be used to 
 modify the behavior, as indicated by this statement. But it doesn't stop there; by providing 
 switches, you can control the behavior of 
 regexp
 . The switches are as follows:
  
 Switch 
  
 Behavior
  
 -about 
  
 No actual matching is made. Instead 
 regexp
  returns a list containing 
  
 information about the regular expression where the first element is a 
  
 subexpression count and the second is a list of property names describing 
  
 various attributes about the expression.
  
 -expanded 
  
 Allows the use of expanded regular expression, wherein whitespaces and 
  
 comments are ignored.
  
 -indices 
  
 Returns a list of two decimal strings, containing the indices in the string to 
  
 match for the first and last characters in the range.
  
 -line 
  
 Enables the newline-sensitive matching similar to passing the –
 linestop
  
 and 
 –lineanchor
  switches.
  
 -linestop 
  
 Changes the behavior of [^] bracket expressions and the ""."" character so 
  
 that they stop at newline characters.
  
 -lineanchor 
  
 Changes the behavior of ^ and $ (anchors) so that they match both the 
  
 beginning and end of a line.
  
 -nocase 
  
 Treats uppercase characters in the search string as lowercase.
  
 -all 
  
 Causes the command to match as many times as possible and returns the 
  
 count of the matches found.
  
 -inline 
  
 Causes 
 regexp
  to return a list of the data that would otherwise have been 
  
 placed in match variables.
  
 Match variables may NOT be used if 
 –inline
  is specified.
  
 -start 
  
 Allows us to specify a character index from which searching should start.

 regsub 
 command accepts a string and using Regular Expression pattern matching, it locates and, if 
 desired, replaces the pattern with the desired value. The syntax of 
 regsub

 Now that we have a background in switches as they apply to the 
 regsub
  command, let's look 
 at the command:
  
 regsub switches expression string substitution variable
  
 The 
 regsub
  command matches the expression against the string provided and either copies 
 the string to the variable or returns the string if a variable is not provided. If a match is 
 located, the portion of the string that matched is replaced by substitution. Whenever a 
 substitution contains an 
 &
  or a 
 \0
  character, it is replaced with the portion of the string that 
 matches the expression. If the substitution contains the switch ""
 \n
 "" (where 
 n
  represents a 
 numeric value between 1 and 9), it is replaced with the portion of the string that matches with 
 the nth sub-expression of the expression. Additional backslashes may be used in the 
 substitution to prevent interpretation of the 
 &
 , 
 \0
 , 
 \n
 , and the backslashes themselves. As 
 both the 
 regsub
  command and the Tcl interpreter perform backslash substitution, you should 
 enclose the string in curly braces to prevent unintended substitution.",NA

Parsing a string using conversion specifiers,"To parse a string in Tcl using conversion specifiers we will be using the

 the 
 scan
  command does not accept switches such as the 
 regexp

 we will proceed directly to the command. The syntax of the command is as follows:
  
 scan string format variable variable variable…
  
 The 
 scan
  command accepts a string to parse and based on the format provided, it 
 will convert the string. If variables are provided, they will be updated to the output 
 of the conversions.

 the input to be parsed, while the format instructs the command on how to parse it using the

 variables are provided then 
 scan
  will behave in an inline mode and return the data. If no

Determining the length of a string,"To determine the length of a string, Tcl provides the 
 length
  keyword. The 
 length
  
 command will return a decimal string containing the number of bytes used to represent the 
 value contained within the variable in memory. Please note that as UTF-8 uses one to three 
 bytes for Unicode characters; the byte length will not be the same as the character length, in 
 most circumstances. The syntax of

Comparing strings,"In any of the programs, string comparison is critical for many reasons. To perform string 
 comparison, Tcl provides two keywords for use with the 
 string

Determining the class of a string,"Although a string is generally considered to be an alphanumeric character, it can also 
 belong to a class of strings. These classes allow us to manipulate the string in a manner

 error or unexpected return value. To assist us in determining the class of the string, Tcl 
 provides the 
 is
  keyword and a list of associated classes.
  
 The syntax for the

Introduction,"Now that we have a firm grasp on the string type, let's look at the Tcl command 
 list
 . As you 
 might have discerned from the command name, this command is used to create and manage 
 lists of information. While the various string handling commands allow for the creation of a 
 string containing anything from a single character to larger text files, the list allows you to 
 create, manipulate, and utilize a list of arguments in the same manner as a shopping list. In 
 Tcl, each of the separate items in a list are referred to as elements.
  
 In the following sections, we will examine not only the creation of a list, but also the 
 many commands provided by Tcl to allow you to fully utilize the list and its elements. 
 As a pre-requisite for the recipes in this chapter, launch the Tcl shell appropriately for 
 your operating system. You can access Tcl from the command line to execute the 
 commands.",NA
Creating a list,"One way to create a list is to simply use the 
 list
  command. Bear it in mind that with this 
 command you must be aware of quotations. Inconsistent quotations can have unexpected 
 results on the list elements. The syntax is as follows:
  
 list value1 value2…",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will create a list containing single characters. Return values 
 from the commands are provided for clarity. Enter the following command:
  
 % list John Mary Bill
  
 John Mary Bill",NA
How it works…,"The 
 list
  commands returns a list containing all the arguments supplied, or an empty string 
 if no arguments are specified. Backslashes and braces are added to the string representation 
 of the list as it is necessary to provide a properly formatted list that will work with any 
 list 
 command.",NA
There's more…,"As mentioned earlier, quotation marks can alter how items are stored in our list. In the 
 following example, we will recreate our list; but this time the elements will be encased 
 in quotation marks to illustrate their effect on our list. Enter the following command:",NA
Joining two lists,"Now that we have seen how to make a list we will explore combining lists. To accomplish 
 this, Tcl provides the 
 concat
  command. The syntax is as follows:
  
 concat value1 value2 …",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will concatenate a set of lists containing single characters. 
 Return values from the commands are provided for clarity. Enter the following 
 command:
  
 % concat {a b c} {1 2 3}
  
 a b c 1 2 3",NA
How it works…,"The 
 concat
  command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after first 
 trimming all leading and trailing whitespace, and in the case of a list, the results will be 
 flattened. 
  
 Although this command will concatenate any arguments provided, we will be focusing on its 
 usage as it applies to the list elements. To denote that a list is being provided as the argument, 
 it should be encased within braces {}. This is another method of providing lists. They may also 
 be passed as named list variables, actual list commands, or within quotes. If no arguments are 
 provided, it will return an empty string.",NA
There's more…,"In the following example, we will concatenate a list containing string values with 
 additional string values to illustrate using 
 concat
  to expand the elements in our list. 
 Return values from the commands are provided for clarity. Enter the following 
 command:
  
 % concat {John Mary Bill} Tom Fred Sally
  
 John Mary Bill Tom Fred Sally
  
 As you can see in this example, the return value is a string containing not only our list but also 
 the individual arguments provided.",NA
Joining list elements,"While the 
 concat
  command is more than capable of merging lists and arguments into a 
 single list, Tcl also provides the 
 join
  command to expand the functionality. The 
 join 
 command will not only merge the arguments, but also allows insertion of a separation 
 character into the returned string. Note that the variable provided must contain a list, set 
 of lists, or standalone values. The syntax is as follows:
  
 join list delimiter",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will join the elements of a list and create a comma-delimited 
 string. Return values from the commands are provided for clarity. Enter the following 
 command:
  
 % set input {John Mary Bill}
  
 John Mary Bill
  
 % join $input "", ""
  
 John, Mary, Bill",NA
How it works…,"The 
 join
  command returns the complete string created by joining all elements of the variable 
 provided. If a delimiter is specified, it will create a delimited list, otherwise the string will be 
 returned space delimited.",NA
There's more…,"In the following example, we will join two lists in the same manner as the 
 concat
  command 
 and convert the lists into a single string value. Return values from the commands are provided 
 for clarity. Enter the following command:
  
 % set input {{John Mary Bill} {Tom Fred Sally}}
  
 {John Mary Bill} {Tom Fred Sally}
  
 % join $input
  
 John Mary Bill Tom Fred Sally
  
 As you can see, the 
 join
  command has accepted the arguments and returned a string 
 containing the elements of the two lists flattened.",NA
Appending list elements,"Up to this point, we have manually populated the elements of our list. While this is a usable 
 method for list creation, it will become a necessity to programmatically populate the 
 elements of a list at some point. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 lappend
  command. 
 The syntax is as follows:
  
 lappend variable value1 value2 …",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will append elements to a list. Return values from the commands 
 are provided for clarity. Enter the following command:
  
 % set input {John Mary Bill}
  
 John Mary Bill 
  
 % lappend input Tom
  
 John Mary Bill Tom",NA
How it works…,"The 
 lappend
  command has treated the variable name provided in variable as a list and 
 appended all the following values to variable as list elements.",NA
Assigning list elements to variables,"At this point, we have created, concatenated, joined and appended to our list. Next we need 
 to know how to assign the elements of a list to variables to be able to access the individual 
 elements. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 lassign
  command. The syntax is as 
 follows:
  
 lassign list variable1 variable2 …",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will assign the elements of our list to a set of variables and print 
 out the values contained within the variables. Return values from the commands are provided 
 for clarity. Enter the following command:
  
 % lassign {John Mary Bill Tom Fred} 1 2 3
  
 Tom Fred
  
 % puts ""$1 $2 $3""
  
 John Mary Bill",NA
How it works…,"The 
 lassign
  command accepts a list as the first argument and assigns the elements to the 
 variables given in the following arguments. If there are more variables than list elements, 
 they will contain empty strings. If there are more elements than variables, a list of 
 unassigned elements will be returned, as in the preceding example with 
 Tom
  and 
 Fred
 . Note 
 that the command provides no return unless the number of elements exceeds the count of 
 the variables provided.",NA
Retrieving an element from a list,"While the ability to assign the elements of a list to variables is a wonderful method of 
 retrieving the values, it would be beneficial to access the elements directly without the 
 necessity of variable assignment. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 lindex
  command. 
  
 The syntax is as follows:
  
 lindex list index1 index2 …",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will create a list and pass an index to the 
 lindex
  command to 
 retrieve the value stored at the index. Return values from the commands are provided for 
 clarity. Enter the following command:
  
 % set input {John Mary Bill}
  
 John Mary Bill
  
 % lindex $input 1
  
 Mary",NA
How it works…,"The 
 lindex
  command accepts the 
 list
  parameter and treats it as a Tcl list. If the index 
 values are provided, it will return the element referenced by the indices. Please note that a 
 list is returned if an element is a list and that additional index values will return the elements 
 from sublists.",NA
Inserting elements into a list,"Now that we have an introduction to the usage of indices within a list, it is time to investigate 
 how to insert items into a list at an arbitrary position as opposed to simply appending data. 
  
 To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 linsert
  command. The syntax is as follows:
  
 linsert list index element1 element2 …",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will insert an element into a list at a predefined location. 
 Return values from the commands are provided for clarity. Enter the following

How it works…,"The 
 linsert
  command returns a new list from the list provided by inserting additional 
 elements just before the element referenced by the index. This was illustrated by creation 
 of the list 
 newinput
  and the subsequent 
 puts
  commands to display the contents of both 
 the original and new lists. If the value contained in the index is less than or equal to 0, it 
 will be inserted at the beginning.",NA
Determining the number of elements,"To provide more flexibility to our programs, it will be necessary to create and maintain 
 your lists dynamically. As this will result in a list of indeterminate size, we need a means 
 to determine the number of elements in a list. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 llength 
 command. The syntax is as follows:
  
 llength list",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will pass a list to the 
 llength
  command to determine the 
 number of elements the list contains. Return values from the commands are provided for

How it works…,"The 
 llength

 multiple elements) as an argument and returns a decimal string containing the number of 
 elements. As the embedded list is a single item, in the parent list the total is 
 3

Getting a list element,"As we can now determine the number of elements contained within a list, it is time to 
 retrieve one or more of those elements. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 lrange

 last
  is 
 greater than or equal to the number of elements, it is treated as if it were 
 end
 , as described 
 previously, where indexes are concerned.",NA
Repeating elements,"At some point, you may want to populate a list with a number of repeated elements. This 
 may be for testing or various other reasons. To accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 lrepeat 
 command. The syntax is as follows:
  
 lrepeat number element1 element2 …",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will use the 
 lrepeat
  command to create a list of repeated 
 characters. Return values from the commands are provided for clarity. Enter the

 {0 0 0} {0 0 0} {0 0 0}
  
 As you can see, by combining the 
 lrepeat
  command we have created a list containing the 
 same element repeated three times.",NA
Replacing elements,"To truly have a dynamic list we need the ability to replace existing elements with new

 last
  elements to be replaced. If the list is empty, the 
 indices are ignored.",NA
Reversing elements,"Again, to maintain the dynamics of a list, it may be necessary to reverse the elements. To 
 accomplish this, Tcl provides the 
 lreverse
  command. The syntax is as follows:
  
 lreverse list",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will use the 
 lreverse
  command to reverse the elements in our

 e d c b a",NA
How it works…,"The 
 lreverse
  command accepts a list and returns a list containing the elements in 
 reverse order.",NA
Searching a list,"As with any data contained within a program, it is the ability to locate and use that data 
 that makes the program usable. To accomplish this, Tcl provides not only a command, but 
 also a full complement of option flags to tailor the search. The 
 lsearch
  command allows 
 us to search a list to determine if it contains a particular element. Before we explore the 
 syntax, we will first need to understand the options. The options are as follows:
  
  
 Type of option
  
 Option name
  
 Interpretation
  
  
 Matching style 
  
 -exact
  
 The pattern is a literal string that is compared 
  
 options
  
 -glob
  
 against each element.
  
 The pattern is a glob-style pattern that is matched 
  
 against each element in the same manner, as a 
  
 string match.
  
 -regexp 
 The pattern is treated as a regular expression and matched 
 against each element.
  
 -sorted 
 The list elements are sorted in order. If specified, 
 lsearch
  
 will use a more efficient search 
  
 algorithm. The list is assumed to be sorted in ascending order and to 
 contain ASCII strings. This option is mutually exclusive with 
 –glob
  
 and 
 –regexp
  options and is treated the same as the 
 –exact
  option 
 when either 
 –a
  or 
 –not
  is specified.

Introduction,"Up to this point, we have primarily entered the data through the command line. While this 
  
 is fine for small scripts, it does not provide the means to obtain and store information. To 
  
 accomplish this, we need to read and write to the file system.
  
 File access is a basic requirement for dynamic programs. Whether it's a text-based configuration 
  
 file or images to display, most programs use the file system as the storage and retrieval location. 
  
 All storage needs have—historically and continually—relied on the file system.
  
 Although we will be dealing with strings in the coming sections, the requirements for 
  
 accessing any type of file, from the string data to images, remain the same.
  
 In the following sections, for the majority of the examples, we will be accessing the file 
  
 system to read and write the data to a file. To accomplish this, you will need to launch 
  
 your Tcl shell appropriately, based on your operating platform and follow the instructions.",NA
Opening a file,"The first item we will cover is how to open a file. When you open a file, Tcl creates what 
 it refers to as a ""channel"" that can be read from and written to. Channels are also 
 created for serial ports, external command pipelines, and when opening sockets.
  
 The Tcl command to open a file is aptly named 
 open
 . The 
 open
  command accepts numerous 
 flags to control access and permissions. These are covered in the following:
  
 Access 
  
 Interpretation
  
 r 
  
 Opens the file for reading only.
  
 The file must already exist.
  
 Default access.
  
 r+ 
  
 Opens the file for reading and writing.
  
 The file must already exist.
  
 Opens the file for writing only. w 
  
 The file 
 will
  be truncated if it already exists.
  
 If no named file exists, it will be created.
  
 w+ 
  
 Opens the file for reading and writing.
  
 The file 
 will
  be truncated if it already exists.
  
 If the named file does not exist, it will be created.
  
 Opens the file for writing only. a 
  
 If the named file does not exist, it will be created.
  
 This will set the file pointer (to the point at which writing will 
 commence) to the end of the file prior to each write.
  
 a+ 
  
 Opens the file for reading and writing.
  
 If the named file does not exist, it will be created.
  
 Sets the file pointer to the end of the file.
  
 All the legal access in the table may have the character '
 b
 ' added as the second or third 
 character (for example 
 wb
 ) to indicate that the open channel should be configured for 
 binary access. Additionally, the file access can be altered after it has been opened with the 
 fconfigure
  command covered in the next section.
  
 In the second acceptable form, access consists of a list of the following flags, all of which have 
 the standard POSIX meaning. One of the flags 
 must
  be 
 RDONLY
 , 
 WRONLY
 , or 
 RDWR
 .",NA
How to do it…,"Enter the following command:
  
 % set fp [open text.txt a+]
  
 file5",NA
How it works…,"As you can see the 
 open
  command has returned a file pointer named 
 file5

 file with the permissions set to 
 a+

 permission notations. Please note that the file pointer is intended to be an opaque value and 
 may not be the same for subsequent invocations.
  
 The 
 open
  command will open the file referenced by 
 filename
  with the 
 access
  type and 
 permissions
  provided and return a file pointer. Note that we have paired this with the 
 set
  command to allow access to the file pointer named 
 fp

 access to the pointer is required to interact with the file.",NA

 was displayed.",NA
Configuring a file,"As mentioned previously, you may use the 
 fconfigure
  command to set or get the 
 configuration options for an open channel. The syntax is as follows:
  
 fconfigure channel name value name value…
  
 If invoked with no option names or values, the 
 fconfigure
  command will return the 
 configuration options for the channel specified. Optionally, a configuration name may be 
 passed to get the configurations for the option specified. If name and value pairs are passed 
 the file will be configured based on the name/value pairs supplied.
  
 The syntax of acceptable options and their descriptions are as follows:
  
 Option 
  
 Description
  
 -blocking boolean 
  
 This determines if the I/O operations can result in indefinite 
  
 blocking. Acceptable values must be provided in the standard 
 Tcl 
  
 Boolean format.
  
 -buffering value 
  
 If set to 
 full
  all output is buffered until a 
 flush
  command is 
  
 invoked. If set to 
 line
 , then the system will automatically flush 
  
 when a newline character is output. If set to 
 none
  the system will 
  
 flush after each operation.
  
 -buffersize size 
  
 The value of 
 size
  may be any valid integer value. This will 
  
 configure the size for the buffer s in bytes and allocate the 
  
 specified amount for the channel. 
  
 -encoding name 
  
 This will set the encoding for the channel to allow data to be 
  
 converted to and from Unicode for use by Tcl. Default 
 encoding 
  
 is system and locale specific.",NA
 How to do it…,"Enter the following command:

 line returned the value for blocking, based on the new configuration.",NA
Opening a command pipeline,"As mentioned previously, the 
 open
  command can be used to open a command pipeline. A 
 commandpipeline is a mechanism that allows us to read from or write to a command. The 
 syntax is similar to the standard 
 open
  command. However, if the first character passed as an 
 argument to the 
 open
  command is a pipe character (
 |
 ) the remaining characters are treated 
 as a list of arguments describing a command pipeline that is to be invoked. The syntax is as 
 follows:
  
 open | command access_permissions
  
 The arguments provided by 
 command
  are similar to those used for the 
 exec
  command. The 
 open
  command will return a file pointer that may be used to write to the specified 
 command's input pipe or read from its output pipe. The specific functionality (read or write) 
 is determined by the access permissions.
  
 If the 
 open
  command or one of the commands provided as arguments should return an 
 error, a Tcl error will be generated when the close command is invoked on the channel 
 unless the pipeline has been configured for non-blocking. If the channel is configured for 
 non-blocking, no exit status will be returned.",NA
How to do it…,"Enter the following command:
  
 %set fp [open ""|cmd.exe /c dir text.txt"" r]

  Puts ""Error: $err"" 
  
 } 
  
 %",NA
How it works…,"As you can see, the 
 open
  command has returned a file pointer named 
 fileabb5b0
  to our 
 command. Also, note that because the command was invoked on a Windows platform 
 additional command syntax was required to access the 
 dir
  command. This is due to the fact 
 that Windows built-in commands are not implemented by using the executables themselves. 
 This is not required on a Unix- or a Linux-based system.
  
 The return of the command was accessible as we had set the file privileges to 
 r
  (open the file 
 for ""read-only"" and the file must exist) and the return was read into our 
 data
  variable and 
 displayed on the console. The returns are specific to your platform and will vary based on 
 the platform and path variables in place.
  
 We next used a 
 catch
  statement to trap any errors that might have resulted. These would be 
 returned by the 
 close
  command. As we successfully executed our 
 dir
  command, there were 
 no error codes returned and the 
 catch
  statement simply returned us to our console prompt 
 without invoking the 
 puts
  command.",NA
There's more…,"Now enter the following command line:

 In this instance, we have performed the same command with the exception that we have 
 referenced a non-existing file. As you can see, the 
 catch
  command has trapped the error 
 return and the 
 puts
  command was used to display it on the console. Please note that the 
 basic return from the command was displayed when we set the variable 
 data
  with the 
 read 
 command, but this is not always indicative of a successful return code.",NA
Writing a file,"Writing to a file is accomplished in the same manner as writing to the console. Using the 
 puts 
 command with the addition of a file channel descriptor will result in the string 
 provided being written to the channel. The syntax is as follows:
  
 puts -nonewline channel string",NA
How to do it…,"Enter the following command:
  
 % set fp [open text.txt a]
  
 file5
  
 % puts $fp ""Hello Again""
  
 % flush $fp",NA
How it works…,"The 
 puts
  command will write the data contained in 
 string
  to the referenced 
 file 
 pointer
 . If the optional 
 –nonewline
  switch is provided the newline character will not be 
 added. Bear in mind that if you are not closing the file following the write action, it is 
 necessary to 
 flush
  the channel to complete the write. The channel is automatically 
 flushed when the file pointer is closed or when the application exits.
  
 To check the file, open it with the text editor of your choice. You should see a file that 
 contains the following:
  
 Hello World",NA
Reading a file,"Reading a file allows us to retrieve the stored data from the open channel. To accomplish this 
 Tcl provides the 
 read
  command. The command utilizes two forms. The syntax is as follows:
  
 read -nonewline channel
  
 read channel number",NA
How to do it…,"Enter the following command:
  
 % set fp [open text.txt r]
  
 file5
  
 % read $fp
  
 Hello World",NA
How it works…,"In the first form, the 
 read
  command reads 
 all
  the data from the 
 channel
 . If the optional 
 –
 nonewline
  switch is provided then the last character of the file is discarded if it is a 
 newline. 
  
 In the second form, the 
 number
  argument instructs the command to return the number of 
 characters specified unless there are fewer characters in the file in which case all characters 
 will be returned.
  
 By using the 
 read
  command we accessed the channel and the data read from the file was 
 displayed. As referenced in the previous tables detailing access permissions, the channel 
 can be set to non-blocking with the optional 
 NONBLOCK
  POSIX keyword. If the channel is 
 configured for non-blocking, you may not obtain all data available rather than blocking for 
 more data. This is of primary importance when dealing with open sockets, serial ports, and 
 command channels.
  
 Optionally, you may read from a file by utilizing the 
 gets
  command. This command reads 
 the file line by line and is invoked with the following syntax:
  
 gets channel optionalVariable
  
 This command will read in the next line from the channel referenced by 
 channel
  and display 
 it to the screen if no 
 optionalVariable
  is provided. If an 
 optionalVariable
  is provided, 
 it will be set to the contents of the line read in.",NA
Closing a file,"After any write to a file, you should close it to complete the process. Although exiting a 
 program will close the channel, this is not my preferred manner as a program error may 
 result in the loss of any data that has not been written to disk. To close the file, Tcl provides 
 the 
 close
  command. The syntax is as follows:
  
 close channel",NA
How to do it…,"Enter the following command:
  
 % set fp [open text.txt a] 
  
 file5 
  
 % puts $fp ""Hello Again"" 
  
 % close $fp",NA
How it works…,"The 
 close
  command flushes the open channel of any pending data resulting in a write to disk 
 and closes the channel. As you can see the 
 close
  command has closed the file successfully as 
 there were no errors returned.
  
 To check the file, open it with your text editor of choice. You should see a file that 
 contains the following:

File handling,"Now that we can open, read, write, and close a file, it is time to put this knowledge to work in 
 a real world manner. We will now create a Tcl script that accesses a file, reorders the stored 
 data, and then outputs it to a secondary file. This is similar to a file handling procedure used 
 to clean up user supplied files.",NA

 Since version 8.5, Tk has included themed widgets. They are designed to mimic the 
 appearance of the native operating system and provide a consistent look and feel to our 
 applications.
  
 These widgets are accessed by invoking the 
 ttk::
  namespace. For example, where we 
 created our button with the 
 button

 via the 
 ttk::button
  command, as opposed to the

Writing to the console,"Although rarely used in live programs, the console is a valuable tool during initial 
 development. It allows us to direct debugging information easily, without requiring 
 the overhead of creating dialog boxes (covered later in this book). To allow us to 
 display a console on systems that have no console, or to reveal a hidden console, Tcl 
 provides the 
 console
  command. The 
 console
  command accepts four keywords as 
 follows:
  
 Keyword 
  
 Interpretation
  
 eval script 
  
 Evaluate the script argument as a Tcl script within the console interpreter.
  
 hide

Creating a frame widget,"The framewidget is used as a container for other widgets. Although it works in and of itself, it 
 accepts no input from the user nor does it provide feedback. It simplifies the layout of complex 
 screens and adds to the appearance of the final product. To add a widget to a frame, we use the 
 following syntax:
  
 % 1 frame .f
  
 % 2 button .f.b –text ""My Button""
  
 The naming hierarchy in Tcl is such that we prepend the name of the container. In this case, a 
 frame is prepended to the button to instruct the interpreter that the button is contained 
 within a container. A container can be a window, top level, canvas, or frame, as in the previous 
 example.

Introduction,"For the purpose of this chapter the term geometrymanagement refers to the layout and the 
 design of the interface and not the 
 wm
  command. The GUI is your primary method of 
 interacting with the end user and, as such, is your opportunity to make a good first 
 impression.
  
 Although the specifics of GUI design are not directly covered in this chapter, we need to keep 
 in mind that a poorly designed and executed interface may not only result in frustration for 
 the end user, but also may actually result in the end user looking elsewhere for a solution.
  
 I am sure that you have seen interfaces with bizarre combinations of colors. While they may 
 be the developer's favorite colors in the world, they are not necessarily the best choice for an 
 application. Add in a poor selection for the font colors and you can rapidly create a GUI that 
 is not only shocking to the eye, but also utterly unreadable.",NA
Controlling layout with the pack command,"Tk provides three methods of geometry management—
 pack
 , 
 grid
 , and the rarely used 
 place
  command. We will be covering the 
 pack
  and 
 grid
  commands. The 
 pack
  command is 
 the basic geometry manager for Tk. When invoked, the 
 pack
  command instructs the packer to 
 arrange the widgets as specified. The packer is a geometry manager that arranges the 
 elements of a window in order around the edges. In the following examples, we will see how to 
 use the 
 pack
  command.
  
 Based on the options provided when invoked the 
 pack
  command assumes several forms. 
 The syntactical options are as follows:",NA
 How to do it...,"In the following example, we will create several labels and arrange them using the 
 pack 
 command. Enter the following commands:
  
  1 % label .top -background red -text TOP 
  
 .top
  
  2 % label .bottom -background red -text BOTTOM 
 .bottom
  
  3 % label .left -background yellow -text LEFT 
 .left
  
  4 % label .right -background yellow -text 
 RIGHT .right
  
 5 % pack .top -side top -fill x 
  
 6 % pack .bottom -side bottom -fill x 
  
 7 % pack .left -side left -fill y 
  
 8 % pack .right -side right -fill y
  
 After you resize the window to expose the entirety of the labels, your window should look 
 like the following screenshot:",NA
How it works…,"The first statement requests that 
 .top
  be put at the top of the window. The 
 pack
  command 
 allocates the top of the window to this widget, and makes it fill the top in the 
 x
  direction. 
  
 The next statement does the same for the bottom of the window. For 
 .left
 , it takes any 
 remaining space on the left that is not taken up by the 
 .top
  and 
 .bottom
  widgets and 
 allocates that to the 
 .left
  widget in the 
 y
  axis. The next statement does the same for the 
 .right
  widget. While this is a very basic example, I would like to point out some details in 
 regard to the order in which the labels were packed. Note that the 
 .top
  and 
 .bottom 
 labels 
 are packed prior to the 
 .left
  and 
 .right
  labels. As such, they fill the total top and bottom of 
 the window, while the left and right are contained within the confines of the top and bottom. 
 Had we packed 
 .left
  and 
 .right 
 first, the 
 x
  fill regions would be bounded by the 
 y 
 regions, as shown in the following image. This illustrates the importance of correct ordering of 
 the packing of widgets.",NA
Controlling layout with the grid command,"Care must be taken in packing the widgets to ensure that the desired layout is obtained. The 
 pack
  command provides a convenient method of geometry management for simple forms. 
 However, for more complex forms, the 
 grid
  command allows you to manage your widget 
 placement by creating and configuring rows and columns for widget placement.
  
 To illustrate this better, think of the grid as being similar to a table or a spreadsheet, as it 
 contains rows and columns, as follows:
  
  
 Column 0
  
 Column 1
  
 Column 2
  
 Row 0
  
  
  
  
 Row 1
  
  
  
  
 Row 2",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will create several widgets and arrange them using the 
 grid 
 command. Enter the following commands:
  
 1 % entry .e -width 10

 grid
  command, we have placed our 
 widgets at various locations within the grid as illustrated in the following table:

Combining pack and grid,"It is not possible to combine 
 pack
  and 
 grid
  within the same container. If you attempt this the 
 geometry managers will both attempt to control the screen geometry resulting in the screen 
 failing to load. If you choose to combine the two, you may use 
 pack
  to display a container (for 
 example, a frame), which then utilizes the 
 grid
  command to place the widgets within a grid 
 located within the frame.",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will create a frame and load it using the 
 pack
  command. We 
 will then arrange several widgets using the 
 grid
  command identical to the previous 
 example whose parent is the frame. Enter the following commands:
  
 1 % frame .f –borderwidth 3 –relief raised
  
 .f
  
 2 % entry .f.e -width 10 
  
 .f.e
  
 3 % label .f.1 -text ONE",NA
How it works…,"We are able to combine the two geometry managers due to the fact that the container of the 
 frame is the window itself, while the container of the grid is the frame. In this manner, the 
 geometry managers are not competing for control of the geometry.",NA

Introduction,"Menus are an integral part of the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Most GUI-based 
 applications contain a menu and follow a standard layout and implementation. By following 
 the standard presentation of a menu, we can provide our users with an effective and familiar 
 interface. But what is the standard?
  
 Thankfully, there are numerous standards available to assist in the design and layout of a 
 menu. IEEE, US Government provides requirements for accessibility, language-specific 
 documents, and others provide numerous examples of menu design and these are readily 
 available in print or online. As always, the programs on your computer are an invaluable 
 resource. The companies that sell these programs have invested hundreds of hours and 
 vast amounts of money to ensure that their menus are compliant with the standards. 
  
 Unless otherwise stated, we will need to create a text file containing the commands provided 
 within the recipes. To complete the following example, open the text editor of your choice 
 and enter the text that follows the recipe. Then save the file in your path with the name 
 my_menu.tcl
 .",NA
Creating a menu ,"In Tk the menu is not just a name for a part of your GUI, but also the actual widget command 
 name as well. The 
 menu
  command will create a new menu widget.
  
 The syntax is as follows: 
  
  
 menu name option value…
  
 The 
 menu
  command accepts one or more 
 option value
  pairs, as detailed in the 
 following table:
  
 Option Interpretation
  
 -accelerator 
  
 Specifies an accelerator or keyboard hotkeys to be displayed to 
  
 the right-hand side of the menu text. The specific acceptable 
  
 values are dependent on the display manager in use. For 
  
 example, in a Windows application, 
 Control
 +
 N
  would be an 
  
 acceptable value.
  
 -activebackground 
  
 Specifies the background color to be used when drawing the 
  
 element. The active background is the color used when the 
  
 mouse is over the element and when pressing the mouse 
  
 button will initiate an action.
  
 -activeborderwidth 
  
 Specifies the width of the 3D border to draw around the 
 active 
  
 item.
  
 -activeforeground 
  
 Specifies the foreground color to be used when drawing the 
  
 element. The active foreground is the color used when the 
  
 mouse is over the element and when pressing the mouse 
  
 button will initiate an action.
  
 -background
  or 
 –bg 
  
 Specifies the background color to be used when drawing the 
  
 element.
  
 -borderwidth
  or 
 -bd 
  
 Specifies a non-negative value indicating the width of the 
 3D 
  
 border to draw around the outside of the window.
  
 -cursor 
  
 Specifies the mouse cursor to be used for the window.
  
 -disabledforeground 
  
 Specifies the color to use when displaying a disabled element.
  
 -font 
  
 Specifies the font to use when drawing the element.
  
 -foreground
  or 
 –fg 
  
 Specifies the normal foreground color to be used when drawing 
  
 the element.
  
 -relief 
  
 Specifies the 3D effect desired for the window. Acceptable 
  
 values are 
 raised
 , 
 sunken
 , 
 flat
 , 
 ridge
 , 
 solid
 , and 
  
 groove
 .
  
 -takefocus 
  
 Determines whether or not the window accepts the 
 focus 
  
 during keyboard traversal.",NA
How to do it…,"In the following example, we will create a menu that contains an option to exit the 
 application. Create the following text file and save it in your working path with the name

Adding menu buttons,"The 
 menubutton
  command is very similar to the 
 menu
  command. However, as opposed to 
 creating a standard or pop-up menu, it creates a menu consisting of buttons, as the name 
 implies. The syntax is as follows:
  
 menubutton name option value …
  
 The 
 menubutton

 element. The active foreground is the color used when the 
  
 mouse is over the element and when pressing the mouse 
  
 button will initiate an action.
  
 -anchor 
  
 Specifies how the information within the widget is 
 displayed.

Introduction,"In the Address Book application, we will bring together everything covered within the 
 previous chapters. This will include not only the Tcl commands and Tk widgets, but also the 
 creation of global variables and calling Tcl procedures. We will leverage the flexibility of the 
 dict 
 command combined with the 
 list
  command to read and write our data to disk in a 
 manner similar to a database.
  
 I have also added comments to clarify understanding of various sections. Although these 
 comments are not necessary for the program to operate, you should add them to aid you in 
 the event of any issues you might encounter.
  
 Please note that I have intentionally used step-by-step methodology to complete several 
 items, as opposed to a control construct methodology, to more clearly illustrate sections. For 
 example, rather that storing the widgets in a list and creating them with a while statement, I 
 have created them one by one.",NA
Creating the Address Book application,"As with any Tcl/Tk application, the manner in which the script is created determines 
 the behavior. This is especially apparent when interacting with global variables. The 
 global variables for our application are defined in the main body of the script to allow 
 them to be accessed by the procedures. For the sake of formatting, I have used line 
 continuation characters, ""
 \
 "" that may not be required in your text editor.",NA
How to do it…,"First, we will start by creating the graphical user interface. Enter the following into 
 the 
 address_book
  Tcl file:
  
 # Load the Tk Package

 # Label for Photo Widget",NA
How it works…,"First, we created our interface using a set of Tk widgets. After the creation of the interface we 
 checked for the existence of a data file. If no file existed, we notified the end user. If the file 
 existed, we checked its contents. If no contents existed, we notified the end user. If the file 
 existed and it had entries, we opened the file. After opening the file we configured it for 
 reading line-by-line and then read the data into our dictionary. Note that at this time, if you 
 run the program, it will fail due to the fact that there are missing procedures to load the 
 records and display the photos. These procedures are contained in the following sections.",NA
Adding a record,"Now that we have an interface it would be nice to have records. To accomplish this, we need to 
 give the user the ability to add a record including a photo if desired. This will require that we 
 set up our variables to support adding a record, clear the interface, associate a picture to the 
 entry and then save the record when the user is complete as well as a procedure to load the 
 record for display.",NA
How to do it…,"In the address book file, enter the following text at the location defined in our main page 
 for procedures as defined within the comments:
  
 proc addRecord {} {
  
  
  global currentRecord
  
  
  global recordCount
  
  
  global addressInfo
  
  
  global pictureFile
  
  
  # Clear current entries

  .main.picture configure -image """"",NA
How it works…,"First, we configured our counters (record and total) and then cleared the screen. This is in 
 preparation for the user to add some data. Once the user selects the Save button, we add the 
 contents of the entry widgets to the dictionary and write them to the data file for future use. 
 Then we display the record. Note that if the user simply changes a record and clicks on Save, 
 he will be performing an edit of the existing record.",NA
Navigating records,"Now that we can add records, we need a means to scroll through them. This is where the 
 Next and Previous command buttons come into play. To accomplish this, we will create 
 two procedures.",NA

How it works…,"These procedures simply increment or decrement the record counter if it is within the range 
 of the number of records and then calls our previously created procedure to load the record.",NA
Deleting a record,"Adding records is complete as is navigating between them. So now we need the ability to 
 remove records from both the active dictionary and the data file. This is accomplished with 
 a single procedure. Care must be taken to address the fact that a user may click on Delete 
 when no records exist and to handle the condition where the user has deleted all records.",NA

 we can proceed, we remove the entry from the dictionary using the 
 dict remove

 to create a temporary dictionary containing only the record set desired, write the data to file, 
 read it back into our global dictionary, and display the record.",NA
